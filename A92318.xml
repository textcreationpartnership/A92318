         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <q>YOu have here the Diurnall of the whole Proceſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, it was taken by the hand of a ready writer, a faithfull eare, and an underſtanding head. He was preſent at all the action, and I make no doubt of the fidelity of his Relation, Which beginneth thus:</q>
            <p>THE Houſe for the appearance of the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, was the great Hall in Weſtminſter, where there was a Throne erected for the King, on each ſide whereof a Cabinet, incloſed about with boards, and before with a Tarras: Before that were the ſeats for the Lords of the upper Houſe, and ſacks of wooll for the Judges, before them ten ſtages of ſeates, extending farther then the midſt of the Hall, for the Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons: At the end of all was a Deske, cloſed about and ſet apart for the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and his Councell,</p>
            <p>On Monday morning about ſeven of the clock, he came from <note place="margin">Monday.</note> the Tower, accompanied with ſix Barges, wherein were one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſouldiers of the Tower, all with Partizans for his guard, and fifty payre of Oares: At his landing at Weſtminſter, there he was attended with two hundred of the trayned-Band, and went in, guarded by them into the Hall: The entries at White-Hall,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115498:4"/> King-ſtreete and Weſtminſter, were guarded by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables and watch-men, from foure of the clock in the morning, to keepe away all baſe and idle perſons.</p>
            <p>The King, Queene and Prince, came to the Houſe about nine of the clock, but kept themſelves private within their Cloſets, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prince came out once or twice to the cloth of State; ſo that the King ſaw and heard all that paſſed, but was ſeen of none; Some give the reaſon of this from the received practiſe of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in ſuch Caſes: Others ſay, that the Lords did intreate the King, eyther to be abſent, or to be there privately, leſt pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be made hereafter, that his being there was eyther to threaten, or ſome otherwaies to interrupt the courſe of Juſtice: A third ſort, That the King was not willing to be acceſſary to the Proceſſe, till it came to his Part, but rather choſe to bee preſent, that he might note and underſtand what Violence, Rigour, or Injuſtice happened: When the Lieutenant entred the Hall, the Porter of the Hall (whoſe office it is) asked Maſter <hi>Maxwell</hi> whether the Axe ſhould bee carried before him or noe, who did anſwere that the King had expreſly forbidden it, nor was it the cuſtome of England to uſe that Ceremony, but only when the Party accuſed was to bee put upon his Jury, Thoſe of the upper Houſe did ſit with their heads covered, thoſe of the lower Houſe uncovered: The Biſhops upon the Saterday before, did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily decline the giving of their Suffrages in matters Criminall, and of that nature, according to the proviſion of the Cannon-Law, and practiſe of the Kingdome to this day, and therefore would not be preſent: yet withall they gave in a Proteſtation that their abſence ſhould not prejudice them of that or any other priviledge competent to them, as the Lords Spirituall in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was accepted.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Arundell, as Lord high-Steward of England, ſat apart by himſelfe, and at the Lieutenants entrie commanded the Houſe to proceede: Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> being ſpeaker of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for his accuſation, gave in the ſame Articles which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at his laſt being before the upper Houſe, which being read, his Replyes were ſubjoyned and read alſo, the very ſame which were preſented before in the upper Houſe: Some give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this, becauſe the lower Houſe had not heard thoſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in pulique before: others, that the formality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115498:4"/> required no leſſe, however that day was ſpent in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerciſe.</p>
            <p>The Queene went from the Houſe about eleven of the clock, The King and Prince ſtayed till the meeting was diſſolved, which was after two: The Lieutenant was ſent to the Tower by his Guard, and appointed to recurne upon Tueſday at nine of the clock in the morning. The crowd of people was neither great nor troubleſome, all of them ſaluted him, and hee them, with great humility and courteſie, both at his entrance and at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, therefore let fame pretend what it pleaſe about the malice and diſcontent of the multitude, <hi>That if he paſſe the ſtroake of Juſtice they will teare h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eces,</hi> yet I ſee there is more in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor then in Sight and appearance, and in this Report, as in all others of this nature, more is thruſt upon the vulgar (who ſeeme as well fearefull of puniſhment, as exempt from it, for all their great number) then they doe juſtly deſerve.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday in the morning hee came accompanied, as before, to Weſtminſter; and having ſtayed in the Exchequer Chamber <note place="margin">Tueſday.</note> till nine of the clock, the King, Queene and Prince came, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the firſt day.</p>
            <p>Then Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> being called for, aggravated the Charge <note place="margin">Pyms firſt Charge.</note> which was given the day before, by a very ample Speech: It is impoſſible to call to minde all the Hyperbolees, the Flaſhes and ſuperlative Expreſſions that hee uſed, the maine points were: That it was a Treaſon farre beyond the reach of words, that hee the Lieutenant, a native Subject and a Peere of England, the prime Governour of Ireland, the Commander of his Majeſties Forces, and a Proteſtant in Religion ſhould have in ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and groſſe manner, recompenced his Majeſties favours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed his goodneſſe, and drawne all his Dominions into hazard and perill of their Religion, Lives, Goods and Priviledges: That one of theſe faults alone had beene enough and too much for the fullfilling of the exorbitancy and wickedneſſe of any one man, And that no puniſhment could be thought upon ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat crimes of ſuch a tranſcendent nature.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant with no leſſe moderation and wiſdome, then the other with heate and paſſion, ſpake to his owne defence, and that with ſuch a meaſure of Eloquence and Lively-hood, that his very Enemies were affected with it and doe mervailouſly report of it.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:115498:5"/>
            <p> Hee modeſtly recounted his ſervices done to the King and Crowne of England, his endavours for advancement as well <note place="margin">The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> of the Honour as Commodity of both Kingdomes in generall, but in particular that of Ireland; How he had engreatned and advanced the Kings Revenues there, Reſtored the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches maintenance, Suppreſſed the Out-lawes, eſtabliſhed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Royall authority, and impedited the Tyranny and Uſurpation of greater ones over the Commons, And for the effecting of all theſe Actions, hee mentioned himſelfe the moſt weake and meaneſt Inſtrument, with a wonderfull Prudence, in a middle way, betwixt the affectation of baſeneſſe, or deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedneſſe, and Allejance.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> after the cloſe of his Speech, told him that there were three new Articles adjoyned (by an after ſearch) to his <note place="margin">Three new Articles.</note> Charge, and deſired that he might preſently Reply to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Whereunto the Lieutenant anſwered. It was very ſtrange, that after the cloſe of the Proceſſe, and when matters were come to bee ſcan'd, and examined by proofe, that any new Charge ſhould bee given in; Yet leſt he ſhould ſeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the maintenance of his owne Innocency, and the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Honour, hee was moſt willing to heare them and have them alleaged, provided that a convenient time might be aſſigned him to make his Replies againſt them, as he had done to the other given in before.</p>
            <p>But Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> excepted againſt this, and told him that the Houſe did conceive it to be dangerous to grant any farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Lords of the upper Houſe (who did not think it fit as yet to voyce any particular in the audience of the Houſe of Commons) did retire themſelves, and after a pretty time of ſtay, they returned and declared, That they had found the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſuit to be equitable in deſiring of further time for anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; yet ſeeing the Articles themſelves, neither for number nor weight, ſeemed to bee of that importance, but that he might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out a preſent Anſwere, they thought it fitting to grant no delay.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant then (intreating them to paſſe by and pardon the weakeneſſes of his extemporary Anſweres) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Articles read which were theſe.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>Firſt, That hee had within theſe two yeeres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne forty thouſand pound ſterling, from the Exchequer in Ireland, and imployed it to his owne private vſes.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Secondly, That in the beginning of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Garriſons in Ireland had been maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Engliſh Treaſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That hee had advanced Popiſh and Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous perſons, as the Biſhop of Waterford and others, to the prime Roomes in the Church of Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt hee anſwered, That thirty thouſand pounds were ſet apart for the Kings late ſervice, at his owne moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and moſt peremptory Commands, for which he produced the Kings owne Letter, already approved as his Acquittance at the Exchequer boord in Ireland.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, That at the beginning of that Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as ever before his time, the Garriſons had beene burthenſome to the Kingdome of England, but that he had ſo improved it, and ſetled the Kings Revenue there, that the like is not to be heard in all the times that are by paſt; For which if the beſt endeavors of a Subject may juſtly expect any reward from his King and Country) hee craved leave to thinke that hee rather deſerved many thanks, then the leaſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>To the third, Hee atteſted all the Clergy in Ireland, if ever he had taken upon him any particular medling in advancing their Church-men, or whether he had done any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch affaires, but upon the ſpeciall adviſe and deſire of the beſt and wiſeſt of their number: For his part, when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended the Biſhop of Whaterford, hee conceived of him, as a man of Integrity and Learning, fit for ſuch an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor was there then the leaſt ſuſpition of thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115498:6"/> impieties, wherewith he was afterwards Charged. That he had now juſtly ſuffered for the ſame, and that hee hoped they would not lay a neceſſity upon him to Prophecy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of the future Conditions and Deportments of men: For others of the Church, ſuſpected of Popery, hee knew none ſuch, but ſhould anſwere to the Particulars ſo far as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd him, when they ſhould happen to be alleaged.</p>
            <p>After this the Houſe diſſolved for that night, the kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and the Prince having ſtayed all the time, and the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant was appointed to come thither againe on Wedneſday morning, at which time they are to proceede to the firſt Article, to give an Oath to the witneſſes, and to examine all the Proofes whereon the Proceſſe was builded.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It will be a very hard matter for him to expect every mans teſtimony, and to give his anſweres, eyther for full ſatisfaction or diminution of all objections, which way of proceeding will ſpend at leaſt a fortnight, if not a greater ſpace of time, yet it is thought the lower Houſe are impatient of delayes: The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations are exceeding various and different, about the event of this great action; ſome thinke it will bee impoſſible to eſcape the many and great accuſations laid to his Charge; Others, and that the greater number too, are of opinion that he will be in no hazard of his Life, and that it will not be poſſible to bring him into the compaſſe of Treaſon <hi>(quod tam miſere cupio ut non credam)</hi> his adverſe party is ſo great, and ſo farre intereſſed both in point of ſafety and honour againſt him, that <hi>Flectere ſi nequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He hath all this time carried himſelfe couragiouſly, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration (and withall ſo moderately, that it is to the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) of his very enemies, ſo that he ſeemes neither dejected with feare, nor to affect boldneſſe with confidence, but to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelfe with that conſtancy and reſolution which his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and brave parts doe promiſe.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh Commiſſioners here, have hitherto abſteined from giving in any Remonſtrance againſt the Lieutenant, and doe ſtill pleade to have an immediate dependence from the King, and not from the Parliament of England: There was a report that the Parliament of Ireland had ſent a Proteſtation againſt the Act
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115498:6"/> made the laſt yeere, for the Kings ſupply in his Expedicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scots, as a thing which was violently in part, and in part ſurreptitiouſly obteined from them: But I have learned this to be an untruth. I had almoſt forgotten one paſſage of Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> who in the aggravation of the Lieutenants faults, had this expreſſion, That hee was like the Whore in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs. <hi>Hee wiped his mouth, and with a brazen face ſaid hee had done no evill.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>To this the noble Lord Replyed, That he wiſhed his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence might not be taken for Impudence, That hee hoped ſhortly to cleere himſelfe of all thoſe foule aſperſions which his malicious Enemies had caſt upon him, And hee was very confident that he ſhould give the honorable Houſes full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning his life hitherto, and thought of nothing more hereafter then to retyre himſelfe from all publique im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> gave at this a great ſhout, and deſired the Houſe to take notice what an injury he had done to the hnnourable Houſe of Commons, in calling them his malicious Enemies.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Lieutenant falling down upon his knees, humbly beſought them that they would not miſtake him, and withall gave a large Panaegyrique of their moſt juſt and moderate proceedings, proteſting that if hee himſelfe had been one of the houſe of Commons (as hee had the honour once to be) he would not have adviſed them to have done otherwiſe againſt his deereſt friend: But withall told them that hee might juſtly ſay he had his owne un-friends, which hee hoped in time to make known; nor did hee all this time ſpeake one bitter word againſt Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> though juſtly incenſed, which hath infinitely advanced his Reputation.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I have beene a daily hearer of theſe Proceedings againſt this great Perſonage, now upon the Stage, therefore doe preſume I can give a reaſonable account thereof: The book of his Charge is extant in print, ſo it ſhall be needefull for me only to name the Articles as they were canvaſed: and thoſe deſigned by the Houſe of Commons to be his Accuſers, which were theſe that <note place="margin">The names of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers.</note> follow.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Glyn,</hi> after a large flouriſh, on Wedneſday, told the <note place="margin">Wedneſday</note> Lords, That the Lord Strafford was impeached not with ſimple, but accumulative Treaſon; For, though in each particular Article, <note place="margin">Glyns Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This, hee ſaid, could not appeare but by the fruits, which were eyther in Expreſſion or Action, The Expreſſions were foure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That before ſeverall witneſſes hee had ſaid at Yorke, That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Expreſ.</note> 
               <hi>the Kings little finger ſhould be heavier, to them, then the Loynes of the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the Lieutenant replyed, That having ſpoken ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently before to his juſtification in generall, hee would moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver add theſe few words, by their Favours: That it did ſtrike him to the heart to be attached of ſuch a wicked Crime, by ſuch honorable Perſons, yea that it wounded him deeper, in regard that ſuch Perſons who were the Companions of his youth, and with whom he had ſpent the beſt of his dayes, ſhould now riſe up in judgement againſt him, yet hee thanked God for it, it was not guilt but griefe, that ſo much troubled him, He added That it was a wonder how he had gotten ſtrength ſufficient in ſuch infirmity of body, and ſuch anguiſh of minde, to collect his thoughts and ſay any thing at all for himſelfe: But the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who knowes him to be innocent, had furniſhed him with ſome abilities to give teſtimony to the truth and to a good Conſcience: He therefore intreated, that if eyther in judgement or in Memory, he ſhould at any time fayle, it might be imputed to his great weakeneſſe, And although the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen his Accuſers ſhould ſeeme more ready in their Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115498:7"/> then himſelfe in his defence, yet that might not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his Cauſe, who in very unequall termes, had to doe with learned and eloquent Lawyers, bred up a long time and inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuch judiciary pleadings, and whoſe Rhetorik, he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, might preſent many things to their view in a multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſſe; Hee told them farther, that for theſe many yeeres hee had beene weary of publique ſervice, and that now it was his reſolution, after he had vindicated his honour, to retyre himſelfe, and enjoy his much longed for privacy, And yet hee could not but tell them ſo much, That it had beene his hearty wiſh and deſire, rather voluntarily to have reſigned his places of Honour, like a ripe fruit falln from the Tree, then to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently pulled from thence, as a fruitleſſe and unprofitable wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Branch.</p>
            <p>To the Charge of Treaſon, he ſaid, that under favour, hee conceived that although all the Articles conteined in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment were verified againſt him, yet they would not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to Treaſon, neither ſimple nor accumulative: For (ſaid he) I doe not underſtand by what interpretation of Law, the diverſion of Juſtice can be called a ſubverſion of the ſame, or the exceeding of a Commiſſion, the uſurpation of a new Power. To the particular he replyed That his words were cleerely inverted, for that his expreſſion was, <hi>That the little finger of the Law (if not ſupported by the Regall Power, in granting Pardons for poenalties of the ſame) was heavier then the Kings Loynes.</hi> That this was his expreſſion hee verified.</p>
            <p>Firſt by the occaſion, for hee ſpake the words a long time ſince, to ſome men who had layn impriſoned at Yorke, and were then by the Kings favour ſet at Liberty, whom hee incited to thankefullneſſe (by this expreſſion) towards his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by witneſſes produced by him: In the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their witneſſes hee convinced one of them of untruth, by interrogating him where he was when the ſpeech was heard, and how farre diſtant from him, when the man had replyed, That he was twelve yards from him, Hee anſwered that it was impoſſible for him to heare a man three yards off, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a deafeneſſe that had held him 14 yeeres, which being found true, the witneſſe was rejected.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115498:8"/>
            <p> Another witneſſe (Sir <hi>David Foules</hi> (was brought againſt him, againſt whom he excepted as his known and profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; 'twas told him that he himſelfe did not uſe to admit of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt witneſſes, and therefore was to expect the ſame meaſure.</p>
            <p>Hee replyed that Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> might one day perhaps bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached for perſwading the Houſe of Commons to commit the ſame Crime that was laid upon him as a Charge of Treaſon: But for all this the witneſſe was received, becauſe in matter of Treaſon a mans enemy may witneſſe againſt him <hi>pro Domino noſtro Rege,</hi> 
               <q>Though, I ſuppoſe the Kings advice was never asked for the preſent. This was all that was done for that time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On Thurſday hee was charged with the ſecond Expreſſion; <note place="margin">Thurſday.</note> 
               <hi>That hee ſaid Ireland was a Conquered Kingdome, and that the King might praeſcribe them what Lawe he pleaſed,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Expreſ.</hi> 2.</note>
            </p>
            <q>This they aggravated as a prime note of his Tyrannicall will and affection, that would permit no Law to bound the Subject, but what himſelfe and ſuch as he might draw up by ſiniſtrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, from a gracious and well meaning Prince, and if this were admitted, the whole Power and Liberty of the Republique would be utterly loſt.</q>
            <p>To this hee replyed, That neyther was the Expreſſion in <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> thoſe words nor in that ſence ſpoken or meant by him; The firſt part of it (ſaid hee) cannot bee denied; To the ſecond that hee had ſaid only, That the King was the Law-giver, which he hoped none could deny without incurring the Crime of Treaſon; And that the Kings Sentence was a Law in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not determined by Acts of Parliament, which all but dſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subjects would grant; And that it had beene ever his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to have the Liberty of the Subject, and the Royall Prerogative follow both in one Channell: If either of them croſſed other, we could expect nothing but a ſubverſion of the Common-wealth, eyther by Tyranny or Rebellion; That the Praerogative was like the firſt; the Liberty of the Subject like the ſecond Table, eyther both or neither can be preſerved, That in his duty hee ſtood oblieged firſt to the King, as Gods A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, then in the ſecond place to his Countrey, if it did not croſſe the Regall Power: And therfore hoped that what hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115498:8"/> had ſpoken was ſo farre from being Treaſon, that hee thought a thouſand ſuch Expreſſions would not make up one Felony.</p>
            <p>On Friday the two other Expreſſions were followed; <hi>That</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Friday.</note> 
               <hi>hee ſaid, Hee would not ſuffer his Ordinances to bee diſputed by Lawyers, before inferiour Judicatories, and that hee would make</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To the firſt hee ſaid, that hee had often ſaid (more then once) that hee would not ſuffer his Ordinance to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, becauſe, in him, his Maſters Honour was wounded.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, Hee thought a proportionable obedience was due to Acts of State, as well as to Acts of Parliament, otherwiſe they were made in vaine if that both did not bind in one kinde.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Corke</hi> (though his mortall Enemy) was now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <note place="margin">Corks two falls.</note> and admitted, as a witneſſe, whom in his Depoſition hee convinced of two ſhamefull overſights: For <hi>Corke</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">1 <hi>Interiy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </note> upon his Oath, That the Lieutenant had cauſed to bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined an Ordinance againſt himſelfe, and had cauſed ſome words to be ſcraped out, which words were notwithſtanding ſtill found to be in the Sentence by an authentique Coppy under the hand of Sir <hi>Paul Daviſon,</hi> Clearke to the Councell-boord of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Corke</hi> alleaged, That hee had advanced a Groome of <note place="margin">2 <hi>His Groome.</hi>
               </note> his to be a Preacher, who by a teſtimony from the Univerſity of Dublin he verified to have beene a Maſter of Arts, ten or twelve yeeres before his advancement, Adding withall, that my Lord of <hi>Corke</hi> was an excellent Scholler, who was able to breede ſuch Groomes.</p>
            <p>Upon Satterday, having done with his Expreſſions, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſed <note place="margin">Satterday.</note> the firſt Article about his actions.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> his Caſe, hee Replyed:</p>
            <p>1. That though that Sentence had beene un juſtly given and <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply.</note> rigorouſly proſecuted againſt him, yet the greateſt Crime that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115498:9"/> hee could bee charged withall would but amount to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, or Felony at the moſt.</p>
            <p>2. That hee hoped (though this were true) to obteine a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from his gracious Maſter the Kings Majeſty, as well as <hi>Conway,</hi> and Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley</hi> had lately done, for exerciſing Matiall Lawe in the Northern Army.</p>
            <p>Then hee Replyed to all the parts of the Charge which were foure.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That hee had exerciſed Martiall Lawe in time of Peace,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this hee Anſwered:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all Armies have beene, and muſt bee, governed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by Martiall Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Secondly, That after a long reaſoning hee had heard them ſay, that no delay could ſafely bee granted in Martiall Courts. The fourth Charge was, <hi>That he had not heard the Exceptions</hi>

            <p>To this he anſwered, as before, That he was not Judge in the <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> Caſe, and that he remembers no Exceptions made againſt any witneſſes, To which hee added, that as hee had beene regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Proceedings, ſo hee had beene moderate in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Sentence; For, though the Lord <hi>Mount-Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> juſtly deſerved to dy, yet hee had obteined him the Kings Pardon, for the ſaving of his life, and proteſted that hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing by that Sentence, but in ſome meaſure to repayre his owne Honour, and to give <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> faire reproofe, who was known to bee of an exorbitant and licentious tongue and Spirit: Adding, That if the houſe of Commons would goe on the ſame way with him, and aſſure him that the iſſue of his Charge, ſhould be nothing elſe but to admoniſh him for the time to come, hee would thanke them heartily for it, and ſtudy amendment in all his pretended overſights. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> complayned that hee had jeeringly told him, when the Sentence was paſſed and pronounced againſt him: That ere hee loſt his head, himſelfe would loſe his hand; Hee anſwered, that hee had beene thought to bee very inſolent and haughty, yet hee was never ſo impertinent to uſe this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; If any fault were, it was for undervaluing himſelfe in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That ere a hayre of <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> ſhould periſh, hee would loſe his hand: And truly (ſaid hee) if <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> would ſay ſo to mee now, even in the worſt ſence that can bee conceived, That ere I died hee would loſe his hand, I would take it very kindly from him.</p>
            <p>For the other man hee avouched that hee himſelfe had voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hang him, both becauſe hee was an arrant theefe, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115498:10"/> alſo had fled from his Colours, which by the very Common-Law (and to this effect hee cited a Statute 20 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. &amp; 7. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.) That to fly from their Colours is fellony. Hee concluded That ſeeing hee was not acceſſory to the Sentence againſt <hi>Mount-Norris,</hi> had not ſate there as Judge, had a power to keepe Martiall-Courts by his Commiſſion, had not exerciſed the ſame till a new Command came from his Majeſty, had done no more then ever was practiſed in Ireland, before his time, and had at laſt obteined <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> his pardon, Hee hoped there was nothing accuſable in him but his too remiſſe and too moderate proceedings.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> bitterly replyed, That hee knew the time when the Earle of Strafford was no leſſe active and ſtirring to enlarge <note place="margin">Glynn's E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To this hee Replyed, That for his part, in matter of Juſtice <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply</note> (under favour hee ſpake it) hee thought there was no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to bee made betwixt a Peere of the Land, and one of the Commons, except they did thinke that eyther feare or faction ſhould doe ſomething, which had no place in him.</p>
            <p>To the Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Act of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. anſwered it ſelfe ſufficiently, both becauſe it excepted the Court of Requeſts (and that his proceedings were nothing elſe in Ireland, and alſo makes an expreſſe Reſervation of the Kings Prerogative, which hee ſaid was his ſtrength, becauſe hee derived his Commiſſion from the King, and that the Act was the moſt expreſſe warrant in the world for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That hee had not fayled againſt the cautions given by King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were not Charged upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe they were never obſerved, nor could be by the Deputies to whom they were given, which he proved both by witneſſes and writings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Caution made rather for him then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, in that it conteined the word hereafter, which manifeſtly implyed that that power had beene ſometimes before exerciſed in Ireland. And not only by himſelfe, and therefore thanked them for that teſtimonie and hint.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That though the Cautions had beene given to him, yet he had received an expreſſe Command from the king his Maſter, to put that power in uſe, cauſing the Kings Letter, for that pupoſe, to be read; and profeſſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that hee was tender to exerciſe that power, till the King (induced by the humble Remonſtrance of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort of people) had moſt peremptorily, and upon moſt juſt reaſons commanded him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That hee could not obey the Kings Proclamation fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115498:11"/> yeeres before it came out, and that hee wiſhed from his heart, that they would but reſpect the Kings Commands and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, with that tenderneſſe of affection and obedience as he did his Proclamations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hee proved it to be the conſtant practiſe of all Deputies that went before him.</p>
            <p>It was objected that other Deputies had indeede upon ſuits of <note place="margin">Charge</note> Equity determined, themſelves, and matters of Debt; but never of Land.</p>
            <p>Hee Replyed, Firſt that the ſame Authority reacheth as <note place="margin">Straffo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

To which hee added, Firſt the Equity of that Court, that it proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame grounds and evidences of that of the Common-Pleas, and that hee had the aſſiſtance of two of the learned Judges, in deciding the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>Secondly the profit of that Court, which diſpatcheth the poore in a day or two, whereas the Common-Law would keepe them ſo many yeeres, which they are not able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the neceſſity of that Court in that Kingdome, which hath beene ever governed by that way, and therefore impoſſible to debarre the natives from it, without great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, for it would utterly undoe them, and none is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced by it but the Lawyers, And therefore ſeeing that he had done nothing but what was cuſtomary, neceſſary and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Commanded to it, and the Sentence juſt; hee hoped ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for thanks from the State, then a Charge for his ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; withall he ſhewed with what Extortion and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris</hi> had taken ſeiſure of that peece of Land, and made the playing of his game to be very foule; and at laſt hee added, That he had done no more in Ireland, then the Court of Requeſt in England uſually doth, And that the Chancery Court in Ireland doth the ſame daily, and the laſt Chancellor was never Charg'd (ſaid hee) for ſuch Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, though this his Power and Authority was leſſe then mine; But the difference of the Perſon and his Authority (it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115498:11"/> ſeemeth) differeth the matter. And this was the buſineſſe on Monday.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday they paſſed by the 7 Article, and the two firſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tueſday Charge the latter part of the eight Article. Lady</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots <hi>Caſe.</hi>
               </note> parts of the 8, about the Lady <hi>Hibbotts</hi> Land; <hi>That hee had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently thruſt her from her poſſeſſion, by this Summary way of Juſtice, and afterwards purchaſed the land to his owne uſe, by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing the name of Sir</hi> Robert Meridith.</p>
            <p>In this Probation, the teſtimony of the Gentlewomans own ſonne was uſed, of the Lord of <hi>Corke,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris,</hi> all his back-friends, or profeſſed Enemies; and yet they proved very little but what they tooke up upon heareſayes, their prime Allegation was.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That though the major part of the Councell-Boord, had voted for the Lady, yet the Lord Lievetenant had given Decrees againſt her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That all was done to his own behoofe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Firſt, Hee produced the Sentence, under the hand <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> of the Clerke of the Councell-Boord, ſubſcribed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part.</p>
            <p>To the Second, Hee atteſted that hee had no under-dealing with <hi>Meridith,</hi> for the Lady had got her own Lands back from the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Meridith:</hi> Hee alſo declared at length, with what fraude and deceit the Lady had come to her Lands, and upon what reaſons they were reſtored.</p>
            <p>After this Article, they fell upon the ninth; about the giving <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charge Article</hi> 9.</note> of Commiſſion to the Biſhop of Downe, and Connar, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all ſuch Perſons, and preſenting them before the Councell-Boord as contemned the Eccleſiaſticall Ordinances.</p>
            <q>This was aggravated as a point mainly againſt the Liberty of the Subject.</q>
            <p>To this Hee Replyed,</p>
            <p>Fiſt, Hee produced the Primate of Irelands Teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> his hand (hee being himſelfe ſick) that the ſame courſe had been uſed in Ireland before, and that Biſhoppe <hi>Mountgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi> his Predeceſſor in the Biſhoprick of Methe, had had the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hee ſhewed the Equity that ſuch aſſiſtance ſhould bee given to Church-men, who otherwiſe, becauſe of Papiſts and Schiſmaticks, either to God or the King, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thirdly, He proved, by two witneſſes, that ſuch Warrants were in uſe before his time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hee ſaid hee had never granted any but that one, and had preſently within ſome few Moneths called the ſame in againe; what (ſaid hee) was the Biſhop of Downes carriage in it, hee had no reaſon to anſwere for, But hee preſumed the Biſhop could give a ſatisfactory anſwere for himſelfe, when hee ſhould be called in queſtion; And ſo hee concluded that a matter ſo juſt, ſo neceſſary, ſo cuſtomary and practicall before, Hee hoped ſhould not bee Charged upon him as an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new and Tyrannicall Forme of Government, And therefore ſubmitted himſelfe to the Mercy of God, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his Peeres in his Tryall. And this was the worke on Tueſday.</p>
            <q>The ability of this brave Gentleman raviſheth his hearers with admiration, though he bee infinitely ſpent both in Body and Mind, by the continued and almoſt un-interrupted Agitation.</q>
            <p>After the ninth Article was paſſed againſt the Commiſſion iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wedneſday Charge Art.</hi> 10.</note> in favour of the Biſhop of Downe and Connar; Upon Wedneſday Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> proceeded to the tenth Article, the Charge was. <hi>That the Earle of Strafford, having eſtabliſhed an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall Government, over the Lives, Lands and Liberties of the Kings Subjects, his next deſire was to make intruſion upon the Crowne it ſelfe, that by applying to his own uſe the Publique Revenues, hee might bee the more enabled to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his diſloyall and trayterous intentions; To which end, having by a new booke of Rates enhaunced the Cuſtomes, hee had gotten by advantage of his Leaſe, above twenty ſix thouſand pound yeerly. This (they added) was a Crime of higher nature then thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the Preceding Articles, Becauſe in thoſe there was ſome colour or pretext of Juſtice, here none; thoſe in Particulars, this in Generall; thoſe againſt the Subject only, this againſt the King himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Proofe of the Charge, they produced the Leaſe of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
            <p>Which was read and compared with that Leaſe to the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe of Buckingham (which the Lieutenant hath now by Aſſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t) and ſome differences ſhewn ariſing to the ſum of two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115498:12"/> thouſand pounds in the Dukes Leaſe, only the moity of concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and forfeited Goods were due to him, but the whole Goods to the Dutcheſſe in her Leaſe; Againe the Kings ſhips of prizes, did not pay Cuſtomes in the Dukes Leaſe, in the Dutcheſſes they did; Againe, the Impoſt of the Wines (then belonging to the Earle of Carlile) was not in the Dukes Leaſe, in the Dutcheſſes it was; Laſtly, whereas the Earle of Strafford paid but fourteene thouſand pounds <hi>per annum</hi> for the Cuſtome, it was worth to him, as was apparent by the bookes of the Exchequor, forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound. Witneſſes were examined.</p>
            <p>Firſt Sir <hi>James Hay,</hi> who depoſed that the Earle of Carlile had an advantage of one thouſand ſix hundred pounds <hi>per an.</hi> by his Leaſe of Wines.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord <hi>Ranelaugh,</hi> who depoſed that by the inſpection of the books of Accompts, hee had found the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes to be <hi>Anno</hi> 1636, thirty ſix thouſand pounds. <hi>Anno</hi> 1637, thirty nine thouſand pounds. <hi>Anno</hi> 1638, fifty foure thouſand pounds. <hi>Anno</hi> 1639, fifty nine thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>With the Proofe they concluded the Charge; <hi>That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Lord Strafford pretended a great meaſure of Zeale and Honeſty in his Majeſties ſervice, yet it is evident hee had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the truſt put upon him, and by withdrawing ſo great ſummes of money from the Crowne, had weakened the King, praejudiced the Subject of the Protection they were to expect from him, and had beene the cauſe that the extraordinary way of Impoſt and Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies had beene undertaken, for ſupplying of the Royall neceſſitie: And that this Act, therefore, ought to bee enough to make the Charge and Impeachment of high-Treaſon laid againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lievetenants Reply was, That hee conceived hee had <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply.</note> given full ſatisfaction to all hitherto brought againſt him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that pretended Arbitrary Government, nor would hee ſpend time in vaine Repetitions, for the preſent Article, though in all its parts it were granted to be true, yet hee could not perceive, by what Interpretation of Lawe, it could imply the leaſt Act of Treaſon, and when it ſhould be directly Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him as a point of Miſdemeanour, Oppreſſion or Felony, hee made no doubt but hee ſhould bee very able to cleere himſelfe abundantly in that point alſo, yet leſt any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice might ſtick to his Honour, by theſe bold Aſſertions,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115498:13"/> Hee was content to ſteppe ſo farre out of the way as to give anſwere.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it concerned him nothing what particulars in the Leaſe had paſt betwixt the King and the Dutcheſſe of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, or whether ſhe had obteined a more eaſy Condition then the Duke her husband, eſpecially ſeeing that ſame was graunted ſome yeeres before his comming to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet thus much hee could ſay That the Dutcheſſe had paid thirty thouſand pound fine, and therefore no mervaile her yeerely rent was the leſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the booke of Rates (wherein the chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Oppreſſion and Grievance ſeemed to reſt) the ſame was there eſtabliſhed by the Deputy <hi>Faulkland, An.</hi> 1628, 3 yeers before his going into Ireland, and therefore it was exceeding ſtrange, in his apprehenſion, how that could riſe up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That hee had his Intereſt in the Cuſtomes by Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Leaſe from the Ducheſſe, which was given her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Government, nor did hee ever heare it alleaged as a Crime of Treaſon, for a man to make a good bargaine for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That not of his owne accord, but at the Kings ſpeciall Command hee had undergone that Charge, on hopes that upon the enquiry into the worth thereof, the Cuſtomes might bee improved for the benefit of the Crowne, and the true value thereof diſcovered. This hee proved by the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Ingram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, That when a new booke of Rates was recommended to him by the Councell-Board of England, in the time of his Leaſe, he ſo farre preferred a feare hee had, That the Trade of Ireland might thereby be diſcouraged, before his owne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, as hee preſumed, in all humility, to refuſe the ſaid book of Rates, and tendred his Reaſons thereof to the Kingdome and Councell-Board of England.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That hee never underſtood that the Cuſtomes could ariſe to thoſe great ſummes alleaged, but though they ſhould, yet his advantage was but ſmall; for firſt dividing the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thounds hee paid to the King, then five parts of eight, which was yeerely given in upon Oath (and that procured
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115498:13"/> firſt by himſelfe) at the Exchequer Board, the other three parts divided amongſt foure of them which were equall ſharers in the Leaſe, would not amount to any great ſumme of money; And therefore except it were Treaſon for him to have impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Kings Revennue, encouraged the Trade, and refuſed the new booke of Rates, hee could in his owne weake judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſcerne none there, nor could hee thinke it a Crime, for him to take an Aſſignation of a Leaſe, graunted before his time, and to inſiſt in the booke of Rates uſed before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over; And therefore was confident the Lords would rather take his Accuſation as an exerciſe of Rhetorick in the Gentlemen his Adverſaries, then as a thing ſpoken in good earneſt by them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That in the meane time hee had brought in a great quantity himſelfe, and ſold the ſame at exorbitant Prizes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That of Tobacco, already imported, hee had forbidden any to bee ſold, but what was firſt ſealed by his Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, That upon a pretended diſobedience, hee had puniſhed a great number of People, by Seizures, Impriſonments, Fineing, Whipping, Pillory. and ſuch like cruell and inhumane uſages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly, That by theſe meanes hee had gayned one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds yeerely.</hi>

            <p>For Proofe hereof</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Proclamation, for reſtrayning Tobacco, was read.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Proclamation about the ſealing of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some witneſſes, who declared that Shippes had beene reſtrayned from landing Tobacco.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Others who had known ſome Tobacco ſeized on as forfeited.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, declaring that the Earle had fold 500 Tunne of Tobacco, which ſold at 2 s. 6 d. per pound, amounts to 100000 l.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115498:14"/>
            <p> They concluded the Charge: <hi>That hee had ſucked up the blood and eaten up the Kings Liege-people, and had by this one point of Oppreſſion, rayſed greater ſummes to himſelfe, then all the Kings Revenue, in that Kingdome extended unto: And therefore was lyable to the Crime of Treaſon, for troubling the Peace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving the People of their goods, who were entruſted into his Care and Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lievetenantss Reply was,</p>
            <p>That his moſt ſecret thoughts were conſcious of nothing but <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> of a ſincere intention and indeavor to promote and advance the well-fare of that Kingdome; And withall hee conceived (by their leaves) that nothing in that Charge could have the leaſt referrence to Treaſon; yet as hee ſaid before, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of all prejudice, he was content to anſwere:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That long before his comming to Ireland, the ſame reſtraint had been of Tobacco, and the ſame Impoſt of eighteen pence per pound, enjoyned by King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That at that time, the Tradeſ-men for this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity paid but twenty pounds a yeere to the Crowne, for the Impoſt, but now 4000 l.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Parliament in Ireland 1628, had Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have this Impoſt ſetled by an Act of State for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, as a part of the Revenue of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That hee had expreſſe command from the King, for iſſuing thoſe Proclamations, and therefore could not Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine more danger in them, then in others for Monopolies in England, in the worſt ſence.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That the Proclamations were ſent forth not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, but by the whole Councell-Board of Ireland.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That for the contract of Tobacco, hee was ſo tender of it, that it was ſent over hither, and ſeene and approved of by the Councell-Board of England, before it was condiſcended to in Ireland.</p>
            <p>For the Proclamations; Hee told them it was his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (and if hee failed in it, hee humbly craved pardon, and hoped that it ſhould not bee Treaſon to have no more judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then God had beſtowed on him) that the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by God, with a power, to make temporary Lawes, and cauſe the ſame to be promulgated for the good of his People,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115498:14"/> upon ſuddaine emergent occaſions; to which Lawes, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is due, till they be abrogared by enſuing Parliaments; that hee reſtrayned no man from importing Tobacco, who was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pay the appointed Impoſt; that for his part, hee had never Traffict in all his time, in that kinde, nor had any part with the Contractors: And if any Tobacco was ſeized on, it was upon Contempt of the Proclamations; And if any Perſon were cenſured to the Pillory, or Whipping, it was for known Perjury, the ordinary and uſuall puniſhment in ſuch a Caſe: Concerning the Tobacco imported (hee ſaid) no conſideration was taken of the prices given for the Tobacco beyond Seas, of the Kings Revenue of foure thouſand pound, of the Merchants paines and danger, bringing the ſame home: For his part, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantage were made, ſurely it was not his, nor could hee annull every Contract or Leaſe made by the King: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing his intereſt was none, hee had done nothing but at the Kings directions, and at the advice of the Councell-Board; ſeeing the ſame Impoſt was in King <hi>James</hi> his time, and Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for by themſelves in Ireland: Hee hoped the carriage in the buſineſſe ſhould bee ſo farre from a Crime of Treaſon, that it ſhould rather be thought no Crime at all. So much for Wedneſday.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday hee was Charged with the twelfth Article, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thurſday. Artic.</hi> 12. <hi>Charge by</hi> Maynard.</note> concerning Flax, by Maſter <hi>Maynard,</hi> on this manner: <hi>That the Flax, being the native and principall Commodity of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was by him (the Lievetenant) reſtrayned, and the Subjects put to that which was unknowne, yea impoſſible for the Iriſh to make the ſame into Yarne, here they complayned of three things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That by Proclamation h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e had reſtrayned ſelling of Flax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That hee had ordered the making of Yarne of ſuch and ſuch lengths and numbers of threds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That the Native Iriſh, being unacquainted with ſuch Cuſtomes, upon a pretended diſobedience, had all their Flax and Yarne ſeized on to his uſe, whereby a great many families were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch pennury that they died, by great numbrrs in the fields for want of foode.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:115498:15"/>
            <p> For proofe hereof they brought:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Proclamation about the Reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Warrant for ſeizing the forfeited goods.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The execution of this Warrant, proved by Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> Lord <hi>Ranelaugh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Remonſtrance from the houſe of Commons, in Ireland, That upon the rigorous courſe and execution of this Warrant, many Perſons died for want of foode. They concluded the Charge therefore: <hi>Though the Article did not individually imply Treaſon, yet it did make very much for the Accumulation of Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lievetenants Reply was,</p>
            <p>That as before he would and muſt ever repeate it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> was in the Charge that conteined Treaſon, To the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe hee anſwered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Proclamations iſſued forth, were grounded not only upon convenience, but upon neceſſity, becauſe that except ſome way had beene taken for ordering of Yarne, the Merchants had abſolutely given over the Linnen-trade in that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Councell-Board was as lyable to the Charge as himſelfe, amongſt whom were, at that time, the Primate of Ireland, the Arch-biſhop of Dublin, Chancelor <hi>Loftis</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mount-Norris,</hi> all ſubſcribers to the Proclamation, men to them of known integrity and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That nothing was more common, then for the Councell-Board of Ireland to give out Orders for reducing the natives to the Engliſh-Cuſtomes, and to fine them for drawing their Horſe by the tayles, during their Corne, and ſuch like, and hee conceived that to bee a thing of the ſame nature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the ſpeciall thing inducing him to it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee perceived the trade of Wooll to increaſe much in that Kingdome; He diſſwaded by all meanes the making of Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len-Cloth, becauſe of the infinite detriment that might happen thereby to the Kingdome of England, and therefore thought this the beſt way to encourage the way of Linnen cloth; For the Warrant to ſeize upon the goods, hee affirmed the ſame to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115498:15"/> bee neceſſary, becauſe there ſhould be no contempt to Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; But that any part thereof did accrue to him, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied; If any rigour was uſed in the execution, hee ſaid not hee, but his Officers were to anſwere for it; for this might happen in the moſt juſt and neceſſary commands, nor was there ever any complaint preſented to him of any ſuch matter; For his part hee had loſt thirty thouſand pounds in the Manufacture, eſtabliſhed by himſelfe for the encouragement of others.</p>
            <p>To that, that Perſons died by this meanes, hee Replyed, that it was more then ever hee heard, or could thinke poſſible, yea that hee was cleered by the allegation it ſelfe, which ſaith that the ſame happened ſince his comming from Ireland.</p>
            <p>To the Remonſtrance of Ireland, Hee conceived that a Charge was but a ſlender proofe of a Charge, and that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon Interrogatories, not upon Oath, ſeeing that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was not due to the Houſe of Commons, neither here, nor there; that hee might ſay it in truth and modeſty, hee deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much better of that People, and might take up that in the Goſpell. <hi>For which of all my good Deedes &amp;c.</hi> Yet hee hoped to bee better underſtood ſhortly, both here and there, And for his part, though his purſuit had beene very hot, yet God was his witneſſe hee never intended to take the leaſt Impreſſion of Revenge, for thoſe diſcontents and affronts which had beene eagerly put upon him, or to carry any thing hence with him from that Barre, where ſo many foule Aſperſions had beene unjuſtly throwne upon him, but only <hi>Gratuitas Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day a freſh man (Maſter <hi>Palmer)</hi> entred the Liſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charge by Mr.</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>latter part of the</hi> 15. <hi>Article ſeizing &amp; laying ſoul diers upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
               </note> him, who having paſt by, for warit of proofe the thirteenth, fourteenth, and part of the fifteenth Articles, inſiſted only upon the ſecond part, for giving Warrant to Sarjeant <hi>Savill,</hi> for ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and laying Souldiers upon the Subjects, hee Charged thus. <hi>That the Lord</hi> Strafford, <hi>having by a Tyrannicall Power inverted the ordinary courſe of juſtice, and given immediate Sentence upon the Lands and Goods of the Kings Subjects, under pretence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, had uſed a Military way for redreſſing of the Contempt, and laid Souldiers upon the Lands and Goods of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to their utter ruine. This Article (hee ſaid) of it ſelfe did</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:115498:16"/> 
               <hi>conteine an individual Treaſon, ſo that if there were no more then this, it were more then ſufficient to convince him of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here hee offered two things,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The proofe of the point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By what Statute this Act of Tyranny, directly and by it ſelfe, implyed Treaſon: For the firſt, Sarjeant <hi>Savill</hi> was called, who produced the copie of the Warrant upon which hee had ſetled the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>At this the Lievetenant roſe, and humbly intreated the Lords <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> no evidence ſhould be received againſt him, upon an Article of ſuch importance, but what might bee thought authentique, and ſuch a one, under fauour, hee conceived that Copy not to bee.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe no tranſcript, but the Originall only, can make faith before the Kings Bench, in a matter of Debt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore farre bee it from them to receive a moſt ſlender teſtimony, in matter of Life and Death, before the ſupreme Judicatory of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Copies bee at any time received, they are ſuch as are given in upon Oath, to have beene compared with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginalls, which are upon Record, ſuch an one was not that Copy.</p>
            <p>It was Replyed by Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> (for all of them ſpake as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Glyns Speech.</note> ſerved) that the Houſe had but the day before admitted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies as evidences, much more ſhould they doe this, when it was proſecuted by the Officer himſelfe, who beſt knew it, having exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the ſame.</p>
            <p>To this the Lievetenant anſwered, that all other Copies <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> ought to bee received upon Oath, to have beene compared with the Originall, as right reaſon requireth, but that this was not ſo,; And for the Officer himſelfe producing it, that was the beſt Argument hee could uſe, why it ſhould not bee admitted: For (ſaid hee) Maſter <hi>Savill</hi> may bee charged with Treaſon, for ſeiſing men of warre upon the Kings Subjects, hee hath nothing for his defence but a pretended Warrant from me: Now what hee ſweares to my prejudice, is to his own advantage, nor can a man by any equity in the world, bee admitted to teſtify againſt another, <hi>inſuam juſtificationem,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115498:16"/>
            <p> The point ſeemed exceeding weighty, and in effect was the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serjant</hi> Savils <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </note> groundworke of the whole Article, which not proved, nothing could evince him to have beene acceſſory to the Conſequence. The upper Houſe therefore adjourned themſelves, and went up to their own Court, and after a very hot conteſtation betweene the factions, and above an houres ſtay, They returned and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Lords after mature deliberation, had reſolved that the Copy ſhould not bee admitted, and deſired them to proceede to other proofes, which after a little pauſe they did,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Lord <hi>Ranelaugh</hi> affirmes, that hee heard of ſuch a Warrant, and knew ſometimes three, ſometimes five Souldiers Billeted by it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Maſter <hi>Clare</hi> declares the very ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Depoſeth hee had ſeene ſuch a Warrant under the Deputies Hand and Seale: And ſo much for the proofe.</p>
            <p>For the Statute, they alleaged one of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>:</hi> 6. that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould carry about with them Engliſh Enemies, Iriſh Rebels, or Hooded-men, and ſeſſe them upon the Subject, ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as a Traytor. Another of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 7. That whoſoever ſhould ſeſſe men of warre, in his Majeſties Dominions, ſhould be thought to make warre againſt the King, and puniſhed as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. They concluded, <hi>It was evident the Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the penalty and breach of both the Statutes, and therefore deſired the Lords ſhould give out judgement againſt him as a Traytor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Lieverenants Reply was,</p>
            <p>That in all the courſe of his life, hee had intended nothing <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply.</note> more, then the preſervation of the Lives, Goods and welfare of the Kings Subjects, and that hee dared profeſſe, that under no Deputy, more then under himſelfe, had there beene a more free, and un-interrupted courſe of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>To the Charge hee anſwered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Cuſtomes of Ireland differed exceedingly from the Cuſtomes of England, and was cleere by <hi>Cookes</hi> book, and therefore, though ſeſſing of men might ſeem ſtrange here, yet not ſo there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That even in England hee had known Souldiers preſſed upon men, by the Preſidents of Yorke and Wales, in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115498:17"/> caſe of known and open Contempts, and that both in point of Outlary, and Rebellion, and alſo even for ſums of Debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party, there is nothing more ordinary then theſe Seſſings to this day in Scotland, whereby the chiefe houſe of the owner is ſeized upon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That to this day there hath beene nothing more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in Ireland, then for the Governours to appoint Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to put all manner of Sentences in Execution, which hee proved plainly to have beene done frequently, and familiarly exerciſed in <hi>Grandiſons, Faulklands, Chicheſters, Wilmots, Corks, Evers,</hi> and all preceding Deputies times: And had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Outlaries, for the Kings debts in the Exchequer, of Collection, of Contribution money, and (which comes home to the point) for peteet ſoms of money between party and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo that hee mervailed <hi>quâ fronte,</hi> or with what boldneſſe it could bee called an Arbitrary Government lately brought in by him.</p>
            <p>To this the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Loftis,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Teringham</hi> depoſed; the laſt of whom told, that in <hi>Faulklands</hi> time hee knew twenty Souldiers Seſſed upon a man for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pay ſixteen ſhillings ſterling.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that in his inſtructions for executing his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, hee hath expreſſe warrant for the ſame, as were in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi> before him, both of which were produced and read.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That although all theſe Preſidents were not, yet it were not poſſible to governe the Kingdome of Ireland other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which had beene from all times accuſtomed to ſuch ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that no teſtimony brought againſt him can prove that ever he gave warrant to that effect, and for the Deeds of the Sarjeant at Armes, hee did conceive himſelfe to be anſwerable for it.</p>
            <p>As for the Acts of Parliament, hee had reſerved them to the diſpute of his Lawyers, but was content to ſay thus much for the preſent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it is a ground in the Civill-Law, that where the King is not mentioned, there hee cannot bee included. But (with all diſtance to his ſacred Perſon bee it ſpoken) hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115498:17"/> himſelfe to be in his Maſter the Kings place (for ſo his Commiſſion did run) in that Kingdome of Ireland.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The words of the Statute are not applyable to him, for God knowes, hee never went about in Perſon to lay Souldiers upon any of the Kings Subjects.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Kings owne Souldiers, enquiring in a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary way, obedience to his Orders, could in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction bee called Iriſh-Rebells, Engliſh-Enemies, or Hooded-men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the uſe and cuſtome of the Lawe, was the beſt Interpreter thereof, and for that hee had already ſpoken enough.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That it ſavored more of praejudice then equity, to ſtart out ſuch an old Statute againſt him, and none others, though culpable of the ſame fact, to the overthrow and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of him and his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That (under favour hee conceived) for any Iriſh Cuſtome, or upon any Iriſh Statute, hee was to bee judged by the Peeres of Ireland.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That Statute, of what force ſoever was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By the tenth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, where it is expreſly declared, nothing ſhall bee reputed Treaſon hereafter, but what is ſo declared by the preſent Statute, now not a word there of any ſuch Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the eleventh of queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly power is given to the Deputy of Ireland, to ſeſſe and lay Souldiers, although the ſame bee reputed Treaſon in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>To the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt hee Replyed, that a ſlender anſwere might ſerve; Hee hoped that no man would thinke him ſo inconſiderate to warre againſt the King of Britaine and Ireland, by the ſeſſing of five Souldiers, that hee had beene charged by many for taking Armes for the King, but to that time, never for taking Armes againſt him: And that he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſhed that no man in all his Majeſties Dominions, had more practiſes with Rebels and Rebellious Deſignes againſt the King then himſelfe. So much for Thurſday. <q>At the cloſe he deſired the intermiſſion of a day, that hee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115498:18"/> might recollect his ſpirits and ſtrength againſt the next quarrell, and with ſome difficulty obteined reſt till Satterday.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Saterday Maſter <hi>Palmer</hi> proceeded to the ſixteenth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and Charged thus. <hi>That the Lord</hi> Strafford, <hi>having eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Saterday Charge Article</hi> 16 <hi>by Maſter</hi> Palmer.</note> 
               <hi>a Tyrannicall and Independent Authority, by giving ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Decrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Sentences, had deprived the Subject of all juſt Remedy; for in that Kingdome there was none ſupreme to himſelfe, to whom they might appeale; And leſt their juſt grievances might be made known to his Majeſty, hee had obteined a Reſtraint, that no Complaint ſhould be made of injuſtice or oppreſſion done there, till the firſt addreſſe had beene made to himſelfe, and that no perſon ſhould come out of that Kingdome but upon Licence obteined from himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Proofe of this,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Inſtructions were read, whereby that Reſtraint was permitted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Proclamation, That all Noblemen, Gentlemen, Undertakers, Officers, or other Subjects that ſhould reſort into that Kingdome, ſhould not come from thence without a Licence from him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That hee had reſtrayned the Earle of Deſmond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a ſuit in Lawe depending betweene the Earle and himſelf, till publication of the ſame was paſſed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> being informed againſt before the Starre-Chamber, he would not Licence him to come into this Kingdome, till the Sentence was paſſed againſt him.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That one <hi>Marcatee,</hi> having pretended a minde to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, was denied a Licence.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That the whole Committe for the Parliament, was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained this laſt yeere by Deputy <hi>Wansford,</hi> which they ſaid might be interpreted to be his fact, both becauſe they had ſuch intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the one from the other, as alſo by the Proclamation iſſued by him before.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That one <hi>Parry,</hi> ſervant to Chancellor <hi>Loftis</hi> was fined five hundred pounds at his returne, for departing Ireland without Licence.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That the Iriſh Remonſtrance complained of this, as the greateſt innovation and thraldome put upon them ſince the time of the Conqueſt.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:115498:18"/>
            <p> They concluded the Charge. <hi>That by this meanes, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off that intelligence which ſhould hee betweene the King and his People, and having deprived them of that Remedy which in reaſon they might expect from ſo juſt and ſo Gracious a Prince, hee had taken upon him a Royall and Independent Power, and had faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted highly both againſt King and State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lievetenants Reply was:</p>
            <p>That he hoped to make it cleere, that he had done nothing <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> in that particular, but what was Uſuall, Neceſſary, and juſt, and that he ſhould be very well able (by the Grace of God) not only of that, but of all other his publique actions, to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Accompt, though not be free from much weakeneſſe, yet certainly from all Malice and Treaſon.</p>
            <p>To the Particulars,</p>
            <p>Firſt, For Inſtructions laid upon him, he was not ſo much Chargeable as thoſe of the Councell of England, whereof there was a great many preſent who could witneſſe their commands, But leſt any thing ſhould ſeeme unjuſtly enjoyned by them, or embraced by him, hee deſired that the reaſons of their Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be read. which were; <hi>That it were In-juſtice to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of Injuries, of Oppreſſion done in that Kingdome, till the firſt Deputies judgement were informed, and tryall made of his Integrity, that it would much diſcourage the Miniſters of State there, and expend the monies of that Kingdome, if upon every trifling buſineſſe, Complaints ſhould be admitted in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: And that if juſtice were there denyed by the Deputy, it ſhould be lawfull for any man to come over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For the Proclamation. that the ſame was builded upon the Statute of that Kingdome, the 25 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. which conteined the ſame Reſtraint <hi>Verbatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. the Agents for the Iriſh Nation had Petitioned for the ſame from the King.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Deputy <hi>Faulkland,</hi> had ſet forth the ſame Proclamation.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that he had the Kings expreſſe Warrant for it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. which was read.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That he had received the Warrant in January, yet the Proclamation iſſued not out till September after.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That the whole Councell-Board of Ireland,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115498:19"/> had not only condiſcended, but alſo preſſed him to it.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, The neceſſity of the Kingdome required the ſame, for, if the Gentlemen had the Ports open to goe to Spayne, and their Schollers to Doway, Rhemes or St. Omers, it were likely that at their returne they would put fire both in Church and State, and produce very ſad events, by practiſing to diſtemper both.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, He conceived that the King, as great Maſter of the Family, might reſtraine whom he pleaſed from departing his Kingdome without his privity, and here it was not lawfull for any to goe from England without Licence, how much more neceſſary was this from Ireland.</p>
            <p>To the Proofes he anſwered:</p>
            <p>Firſt, For <hi>Deſmond,</hi> He granted he was Reſtrayned indeede, but not for any ſuit of Law betwixt them, but becauſe at that time he ſtood Charged with Treaſon before the Councell in Ireland, for practiſing againſt the life of one Syr <hi>Valentine Cooke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For the Lord <hi>Roch,</hi> he hath often times mervailed with what reaſon, the man at that time could ſeeke a Licence, ſeeing he was a Priſoner for debt in the Caſtle of Dublin, and if he had granted a Licence unto him then, it had beene a farre more juſt Charge of Treaſon then now.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Marcattee</hi> he was afraid of his going to Spain and if he had told him that he intended to goe for England and complaine of himſelfe, he would not have refuſed him Liberty, as he never did to any.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Committee of Iriſh was not reſtrayned by him, and therefore did not concerne him at all.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That for <hi>Parry,</hi> he was fined indeede, But that it is expreſly ſaid in his Sentence, that it was not for coming over without Licence (as is ſuggeſted) but for ſundry contempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Councell-Board in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, That he had Replyed in the laſt Article, a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance was no proofe at all; He concluded that he hoped the leaſt ſuſpition of Treaſon could not accrue to him from the Article; For Oppreſſion or Miſdemeanor, when it was laid to his Charge, he made no doubt but hee ſhould bee able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:115498:19"/>
            <p> The ſame day a new man was hurried out againſt him, (Mr. <hi>Whitlock)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Whitlooks <hi>Charge Article</hi> 19</note> who having paſt over the 17 and 18 Articles, reſteth on the nineteenth, about the Oath adminiſtred to the Scotts, in Ireland, and Charged thus<hi>:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it was the height of his Tyranny, not only to dominiere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Oath to Scotts in Ireland.</note> 
               <hi>the Bodies, but alſo over the Conſciences of men, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hee had enjoyned an Oath to the Scots in Ireland, and becauſe ſome out of tenderneſſe of Conſcience did refuſe to take the ſame, hee had fined them in great ſommes of money, banniſhed a great nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from that Kingdome, called all that Nation Traytors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and ſaid, If ever hee returned home from England, he would roote them out both ſtock and branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Proofe of this,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>Ja<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>my Mountgomery</hi> was produced, who declared at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rge how that Oath was contrived.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sir <hi>Robers Maxwell,</hi> of Orchyardon, who ſpake to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sir <hi>Jo. Clotworthy,</hi> who declared that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber had fled the Kingdome for feare of that Oath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, One Mr. <hi>Samuell,</hi> who depoſed, that upon the tenth of October, 1638. He heard the Deputy ſay theſe words, That if hee returned, hee would roote them out ſtock and branch.</p>
            <p>They Concluded, <hi>That this was a point of the moſt Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Arbitrary Government, that before this time was ever heard of, not only to Lord it over the Fortunes, but alſo over the Soules of men, And that it reſted only in the Parliament, which hath the Legiſlative Power to enjoyne Oathes: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was one of the chiefe points hee had done a gainſt the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Liberty of the Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lievetenant Replyed<hi>:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That every new Article acquainted him with a new Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> that if hee had done any thing in all his life accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the King and the Countray, hee conceived it to bee this. To theſe Particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Hee deſired the Lords would call to minde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe times, no man (pointing to my Lord Steward) knowes better then your Lordſhippe, who had then the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt place in his Majeſties ſervice; I would be very ſory to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115498:20"/> rub (ſaid he) old Sores, eſpecially ſeeing I hope things are in a fayre way to a firme Peace, and I wiſh that I may not bee deceived, that is, That it may be ſo, only thus much I may ſay, we h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d then greater feares and apprehenſions in Ireland, leſt the Scots in the Kingdome (who were above one hundred thouſand Soules) might have joyned with their Country men at home, for the diſturbance of our Peace, meane time we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected a Treaſon of betraying of the Caſtle of Knockfergus, to a great man in that Kingdome (whoſe name I now ſpare) by one <hi>Freeman,</hi> who upon the diſcovery was executed.</p>
            <p>The Councell-Board therefore in Ireland reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Scots an Oath, whereby they might declare their diſcontent at their Country-mens proceedings, and obliege themſelves to the Kings ſervice; But while we were about this; they, of their own accord, came to Dublin, to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for it, and tooke it with a wonderfull alacrity and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, ſo that it is a marvelous falſhood for any man to ſay it was invented, or violently, enjoyned by me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, about the ſame time, the ſame Oath <hi>vrrbum verbo</hi> was by the Councell of England preſcribed, to the Scots, at London and elſe where, which was no ſmall encouragement to us in Ireland.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I had (ſaid he) which I never ſhewed, becauſe I had no neede before this time, a ſpeciall Warrant from the King, all written with his owne hand to that effect; And when the King commands a matter not contrary to Law, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I (ſaid he) doe conceive it both contrary to Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not to yeeld him all due obedience. For the Proofe brought againſt him, there was nothing ſeemed to bee of any moment but the words.</p>
            <p>For the firſt words, <hi>That hee had called all the Nation Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traytors,</hi> Hee ſaid there was no proofe at all, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede could there be any, for if I had ſaid it (quoth hee) I had beene perfectly out of my witts; And, he thanked God, ſuch irrational-ſpeeches uſed not to eſcape him: Hee honoured that Kingdome very much, becauſe it was rhe native ſoyle of our dread Soveraigne, his gracious Maſter, and becauſe hee knew a part, yea (he hoped) the greateſt part of them had beene, and ever will be as loyall and dutifell to the King, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115498:20"/> any other of his Subjects; And of thoſe too who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that unhappy combination, hee knew a great many had done it againſt their hearts and wills, and would bee ever ready upon occaſion to remonſtrate the ſame, by adhering to the Kings ſervice: So that this accuſation was nothing but a wreſtling and perverting his words and meaning, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make him odious, and irritate a whole Nation againſt him.</p>
            <p>For the other words, they were proved only by one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which could make no ſufficient faith, and that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe too hee would evince, if not of perjury, yet of a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake; For hee had ſworne poſitively that hee had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe words the tenth of October, whereas hee was come out of Ireland into England the twelfth of September before, and was at London the one and twentith.</p>
            <p>For thoſe that had ſled the Kingdome becauſe of that Oath he knew none ſuch, and if they did, they fled into Scotland, which might ſufficiently argue their intentions and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For his part, if they were not willing to give that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their Loyalty to their Prince, although hee had known of their departure, hee would have beene very loath to have kept them againſt their wills, but ſhould have beene gladly rid of them, and have made them a Bridge to be gone rather then ſtay.</p>
            <p>Upon Monday Maſter <hi>Whitlock</hi> proceeded to the 20 Article, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Munday Article</hi> 20 <hi>the next</hi> 5 <hi>crowded together.</hi>
               </note> and told him, that becauſe the matter was intervenie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, <hi>&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilis naturae,</hi> they had reſolved to joyne the five next Articles together, becauſe all of them tended to one point or period, that is, to ſhew what bad Deſigne he had to have ſubdued the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes both of Scotland and England by force of Armes, and to reduce them to that arbitrary Government he had lately introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into Ireland.</p>
            <p>The Lievetenant intreated that they would proceede ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order praeſcribed by the Houſe, which was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle by Article; Hee ſaid five Articles were many, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weighty, his Memory Treacherous, his Judgement weake.</p>
            <p>It was bitterly replyed by Maſter <hi>Glyn,</hi> that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">Glyns <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny combe interpoſed.</hi>
               </note> the Priſoner at the Barre, to praeſcribe them in what
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115498:21"/> way they ſhould give in their Evidences.</p>
            <p>The Lievetenant modeſtly anſwered, that if hee ſtood in <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply</note> his place, hee would perhaps crave the like favour, unleſſe his abilities did furniſh him with more ſtrength then he could fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de in himſelfe; for his part he was contented they ſhould proceede any way, alwaies provided they would grant him a competent time for Replying.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Whitlock</hi> went on and told the Lords, that ſomthing in thoſe Articles concerned the Scottiſh, ſomthing the Engliſh Nation, that which concerned the Scottiſh, hee reduced to five heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Deputy had ſaid at the Councell-Board, that the Scotts demands conteined ſufficient matter to perſwade to an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the ſame demands did ſtrike at the Roote and Life of Monarchicall Government, and were only to bee anſwered by the Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That he had cauſed ſome Scottiſh goods and ſhips, to be ſeized on in Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That he had engaged the Iriſh Parliament, by their Declaration, in that warre againſt the Scotts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>That by all poſſible meanes, hee had put bad thoughts and ſuſpitions into his Majeſty againſt his Scottiſh Subjects, and laboured to make a National-quarell between them and England, which, if the Kings piety, and the Prudence of better affected Stateſ-men had not prevented, could not have beene ſoadered up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without much blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning England, his ſpeeches were eyther before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Before his Creature and Boſom-friend Sir</hi> George Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe, <hi>he had ſaid to Sir</hi> Robert K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, <hi>when hee was doubting how the King might have monies to pay his Armies, that the King had foure hundred thouſand pounds in his purſe, thirty thouſand men in the field, and his Sword by his ſide, and if hee wanted money afterwards who will pitty him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That his brother Sir</hi> George Wentworth <hi>had ſaid to Sir</hi> Robert Berington, <hi>upon the diſſolution of the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſeeing the Engliſh would not grant ſupply to the King,</hi>

               <hi>it ſeemes they were weary of their Peace, and deſired to be conquered a ſecond time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That hee himſelfe, upon a diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of Ireland, had ſaid, that hee was much of the minde of thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Divines, who maintayned it lawfull for a King, having tryed the affection and benevolence of his People, and then denyed their helpe, upon an inevitable neceſſity and preſent danger of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he might uſe his Prerogative for his owne ſupply, and the defence of his Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>To the Lord</hi> Conway, <hi>in a diſcourſe hee had ſaid, that if the Parliament (meaning the laſt Parliament) ſhould not grant a competent ſupply, that then the King was acquitted before God and Man, and might uſe the Authority put into his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>That hee did ſay at the Councell-Board, If the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould deny to helpe the King, hee would take any other way he could for his Majeſties ſervice and aſſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His expreſſions after the Parliament were two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Parliament had forſaken the King, and that the King ſhould not ſuffer himſelfe to be over maſteredly the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, obſtinacy and ſtubbornneſſe of his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That if his Majeſty pleaſed to imploy Forces, he had ſome in Ireland that might ſerve to reduce this Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proofe for the Scots Particulars were theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Lord <hi>Traquiere,</hi> who was indeede very favorable to the Lord Lievetenant, and ſpake nothing to his diſadvantage, but what was ſcrued from him, with much difficul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y hee told them, That when hee gave in the demands, he heard him ſay that it was high time for the King to put himſelfe into a poſture of Warre, but that firſt all the Councell of England ſaid the ſame as well as hee. Secondly, That it was a double ſuppoſition. Firſt, that the Demands were truely given in. Secondly, That there was no other remedy left but Armes to reduce them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Earle of Mortons teſtimony (being ſick him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) was produced, and it was one and the ſame with the Article.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was examined, who declared, that he had heard the Lievetenant to adviſe the King to an offenſive Warre, when his owne judgement was for a Defenſive.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the teſtimony of the Earle of Northumberland, was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115498:22"/> produced, which was the very ſame with Sir <hi>Henry Vanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, The Treaſurer of England depoſed the ſame with <hi>Troquiere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, One <hi>Beane,</hi> from Ireland, told that hee had knowne Shippes ſeized on there, but by whoſe procurement or Warrant he knew not.</p>
            <p>To the Articles about England,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>Robert King</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ranelaugh</hi> depoſed the ſame, that Sir <hi>Robert King</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ranelaugh</hi> had heard Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> ſpeake thoſe words in the Article.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sir <hi>Robert Barrington,</hi> of Sir <hi>George Wentworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Primates teſtimony (who is ſick) was the ſame with the Article.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> depoſed the ſame with this Article.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> depoſed, He had heard thoſe words ſpoken at the Councell-Boord.</p>
            <p>For the Words ſpoken after the Parliament, to the firſt.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Jermyne,</hi> Lord Newburg, Earle of Briſtoll, Earle of Holland, were Examined, Briſtoll did mince the matter, But Hollands teſtimony was expreſſe, becauſe of the exceeding great Love he carried to the Man.</p>
            <p>For the laſt, which were the moſt dangerous ſpeeches (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reducing of this Kingdome) there was only Sr. <hi>Henry Vanes</hi> teſtimony who declared only thus, That hee had either thoſe words or the like.</p>
            <p>Here ſome of the Lievetenants friends ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord <hi>Savill</hi> who deſired of Sir <hi>Henry Vanes</hi> to know whether he ſaid <hi>their</hi> or <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that Kingdome,</hi> and withall ſaid it was very hard to condemn a man for Treaſon upon ſuch peettit circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Earle of South-hamton deſired to know whether Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> would ſweare thoſe words poſitively or not, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſaid poſitively either them or the like, The Earle replyed that under favour thoſe or the like could not be poſitive.</p>
            <p n="3">3, The Earle of Clare deſired to know what could be ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115498:22"/> by <hi>this</hi> Kingdome; for his part (he ſaid) he thought it meant of the Kingdome of Scotland, to which the word <hi>this</hi> might very well be relative, that Kingdome being only mentioned in the praeceding diſcourſe. And that he was the more ready to bee of that opinion, becauſe he could not ſee by what Grammaticall conſtruction it could be gathered from his words, that he meant to reduce England, which neither then was, neither is now (God be thanked) out of the way of obedience, nor upon Rebellious courſes.</p>
            <p>They at laſt concluded the Charge, <hi>That the words were ſo monſtrous that to aggravate them, was to allay them, and therfore they would ſimply leave them to the judgement of the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lieutenants Reply was,</p>
            <p>That though the heaping up of thoſe Articles had put him to <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> a great confuſion, yet he would endeavor to bring his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere into the beſt method he could, and firſt he would reply to the Proofe, then add ſomething in generall for himſelfe, in what a hard taking and lamentable condition he was, to have his private diſcourſes, his moſt intimate and boſome friends, ſearch'd and ſifted to the leaſt circumſtance, that he might ſeeme guilty of that which, by God's aſſiiſtance he ſhould never be.</p>
            <p>To the Lord <hi>Troqueeres</hi> and the Deputies depoſitions, hee thought their proofes did not much ſtick upon him, for upon the ſuppoſitions, firſt that the demands were true, ſecondly, that they were not juſtifiable, thirdly, that no other courſe could prevaile: Hee could not ſee what other advice he could poſſibly give the King then to put himſelfe into a poſture of Warre, eſpecially ſeeing then there was frequent reports of the Scotts invading or entring into England, nor was he of any other minde then all the reſt of the Councell-Board.</p>
            <p>For that of <hi>Mortons,</hi> he doth not poſitively remember the words, but if the demands were read perhaps they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply nothing leſſe, and if ſo, how otherwiſe to be anſwered but by the Sword? All other meanes being firſt aſſayed, which is ever to be ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>For Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s teſtimony, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout perſwading of an offenſive Warre, he ſaid, Hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115498:23"/> it very well, and thought it as free for him to give his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion for an offenſive, as they for a defenſive Warre: Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (ſaid he) if they be attended with obſtinacy or Pertinacy may make an Heretique, but that they ever made a Traytor, he never heard till now, nor (under favour) ſhould I bee an Heretique eyther (ſaid he) for as I was then ſo am I now, moſt willing to acknowledge my weakeneſſe and correct my errors, whereof no man hath more, or is more ſenſible of them then my ſelfe: yet, if that opinion of mine had beene followed, it might perhaps have ſpared us ſome money (ſaid he) and ſome Reputation too, of which we have beene prodigall enough.</p>
            <p>For the laſt, about the Ships, it proves nothing but he would willingly confeſſe, that ſome ſhips were there deteined and that by himſelfe and his owne direction, as Vice-Admirall of Connaugh, but it was at the command of the Lord Admirall the Earle of Northumberland, and produced his Letter to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To the Engliſh proofes, He mervailed much how Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> words could be put upon him, Sir <hi>George</hi> (though alleaged to be his boſom friend) yet had thoughts of his own, and might have ſome other thoughts in his boſom, and be to ſome other Expreſſions then Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe:</hi> No man (ſaid he) can commit Treaſon by his Attorney, and ſhould I, by my friend Sir <hi>George,</hi> as by a Proxie.</p>
            <p>For his Brother, He never knew him before ſo raſh, but that was nothing to him, except they could prove a neerer Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then nature had inſtituted, and that his brothers words and his were all one, yet withall he conceived that his Brothers words might be very well underſtood, of the Scotts conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring England, but not at all of the Iriſh, and ſo he wiſhed, with all his heart, that he had not ſpoken ſomthing which is like Propheſy.</p>
            <p>To the Primates Teſtimony (with all reverence to his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be it ſpoken) he is but one witneſſe and in Law can prove nothing, add to this (ſaid he) that it was a private diſcourſe between him and me, and perhaps ſpoken by me <hi>tentandi gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and how farre this ſhould be laid to a mans Charge, let your Lordſhips Judge.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115498:23"/>
            <p> Yea, this ſeemes to me againſt humanity it ſelfe, and will make the ſociety of men ſo dangerous and loathſome to us, that our dwelling houſes will be turned to Cells, and our Townes to Deſarts: That which God and Nature, (our Tongues) have beſtowed upon us [for the greater comfort of venting our own conceptions, or craving the advice of wiſer and learneder men] ſhall become ſnares and burdens to us, by a curious and needleſſe feare, yet if my words be taken, ſaid he with all that went before and followed after, I ſee no danger in them.</p>
            <p>To the Lord Conway I may Reply the ſame, with this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That it is a very naturall motion, for a man to preſerve himſelfe; every Creature hath this priviledge, and ſhall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to Monarchy, provided this be done in a lawfull, though in an extraordinary way, this graine of ſalt muſt be added to ſeaſon all my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>To that of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> of offering my ſervice to the King, I thanke him for the Teſtimony, and thinke he hath done me much honour thereby, but if he or any body elſe doe ſuſpect that his Majeſty will employ me in unlawfull enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, I ſhall think them more lyable to the Charge of Treaſon then my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>To the ſubſequent Teſtimonies, I ſhall not neede to wreſtle about them much, only the laſt of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> pinches, and lies ſore upon me, but to that which the Earle of Clare (and I thanke him for it) hath ſaid already, give me leave to add this, That the Teſtimony of one man is not a ſufficient witneſſe, nor can a man be accuſed, much leſſe condemned, of Treaſon, upon this, and for that reade the Star. of <hi>Hen</hi> 7. 12. and of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords (ſaid he) to give you further ſatisfaction, I ſhall deſire all the Lords of the Councell, which were then preſent (only to the number of eight) may be examined whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they heard theſe words or not, for the Archbiſhop and Sir <hi>Francis Windebanke</hi> they cannot be had, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> gives the teſtimony, I deny it, foure only remaine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Earle of Northumberlands teſtimony, which was read, had declared expreſſy that he had never heard thoſe words, nor any like them from the Lord Strafford, but hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115498:24"/> ſpake with great honour and regard to the Kingdome of England.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who declared upon his oath, that hee had never heard ſuch words, but that hee had heard the Lievetenant often ſay, that the King was to rule his Royall power <hi>Candi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>è &amp; Caſtè,</hi> that it would never be well for this Kingdome, till the Praerogative of the Crowne, and the Priviledge of the Subject went in one pace together, and that Parliaments were the happieſt way to keepe a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency betweene the King and People.</p>
            <p>The very ſame was delivered by the Lord Treaſurer, and the Lord <hi>Cottington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, my Lords, you may mervaile how theſe words reſted only on the eares of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> but my Lords, ſaid hee, that I may remove all ſcruple from you, I will make it evident that there was not the leaſt intention that the Iriſh Army ſhould ſet a foote in England, and then I hope you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I had no meaning to reduce this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This he made cleere by the teſtimony of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the oathes of Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> Lord Treaſurer, Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas,</hi> who only were private to that matter.</p>
            <p>For other of my words my Lords (ſaid he) I deſire you would not take them by halves, if ſo, who ſhould be free from Treaſon? Certainly, if ſuch a praecedent take footing, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall ſhall be more troubled with Treaſon then with Common-Law, looke therefore to the Antecedents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of my ſpeeches, and you ſhall finde the ſtate of the queſtion cleerly altered; the Antecedents were upon an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute or inevitable neceſſity, upon a preſent invaſion, when the remedy of a Parliament cannot be expected; the Conſequents for the defence of the Kingdome, with accompts afterward to the Parliament. The qualifications too in a lawfull, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ordinary way, ſo farre as the preſent neceſſity can permit. Add but theſe, and which of you are not of my mind? Is the King endowed with no power from the Lord? Is hee not <hi>publicus Inſpector Regni?</hi> Stands it not him in hand to do ſomthing on preſent neceſſities.</p>
            <p>And that theſe were his words he often proved, over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115498:24"/> againe, by the Marqueſſe, by the Lord Treaſurer, <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Jermin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>My Lords, what I have kept to the laſt (ſaid he) is this, and I would intreate you ſeriouſly to thinke of it; If a mans Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his Bed, his Houſe, his Brother, his Friends (and that too after they have given an oath of ſecrecy) to be rak't to finde out Treaſon againſt him, who never knew what it meant, what earthly man ſhall paſſe free from Treaſon? Let my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune my Lords, be your advertiſement, your wiſe Anceſtors were glad to put bands and limitts to this Lion Treaſon, if you give him the large ſcope of words to range into, he will at laſt pull you or yours all to peeces.</p>
            <p>But my Lords, I did never thinke till now, that matter of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſhould be objected as matter of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>For, firſt opinions are free, and men may argue both <hi>pro &amp; con.</hi> in all faculties without any ſtaine of his reputation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all conſultations would be vaine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I may be of another judgement then I declare my ſelfe to be of opinion, perhaps to gaine better Arguments for the maintenance of my owne Grounds.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Many, and my ſelfe often times, have propounded my Opinion, yet upon hearing better judgements, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently changed it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We uſe to ſtrayne our opinions too high, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that we may meete in a juſt moderation with thoſe whom we conceive in the other extremity to be too low.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, It is expreſly commanded by the Star. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6 9 that though a man ſhould ſay the King is not lawfull heire to the Crowne, and may be depoſed, yet he is not to be charged with Treaſon, but only with Felony, And I hope my Lords, thoſe words are of a more tranſcendent and ſuperlative nature, then any alleaged by me to he ſpoken: But my Lords (ſaid hee) lay it to your hearts, it muſt come to you, you and your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity are they whom God and Nature, Byrth and Education have fitted to beautify the Royall-Throne, and to ſuſteine the weighty affaires of the Kingdome, If to give your opinions in Politicall Agitatious ſhall be accounted Treaſon, who will be willing to ſerve the King, or what a dilemma are you in; If, being ſworne Councellors, you ſpeake not your minds freely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115498:25"/> you are convict of perjury, if you doe, perhaps, of Treaſon. What detriment! what Incommodity ſhall fall to King and Kingdome, if this be permitted? Which of you hereafter will adventure, yea dare adventure, ſo much as to helpe by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, unleſſe you be weary of your lives, your eſtates, your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, yea your very Honour; Let me never live longer then to ſee this confuſion, yea I may ſay it, this inhumanity in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for my part (my Lords) I here confeſſe my ſelfe, I ever have, and ever ſhal ſpeake my opinion freely, in any thing that may concern the Honor and ſafety, eyther of my gracious King or my deere Countrey, though the ſword be two edged, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rather him that killeth the Soule, then him whoſe power reacheth only to the body.</p>
            <p>Nor doe I ſee how I am culpable of Treaſon, unleſſe it bee treaſon for not being infallible, and if it be ſo, my Lords, you have this rag of mortality before you, loaden with many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; though you pull this into ſhreds, yet there is no great loſſe, yea there may be a great gayne, if by the ſame I may ſeeme to have dared too farre, to give a teſtimony to the World of an Innocent conſcience towards God, and a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute loyalty towards my Prince [which have ever beene my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pole-ſtarres in the whole courſe of my life] and if by ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of mine, there be not a way found how to trace out the blood of the Nobility (which I hope your Lordſhips will looke too) there is no diſadvantage at all ſuffered by the loſſe of me. You have his very words as neere as I could recollect.</p>

               <hi>theſe expreſſions and adviſes conteined in the following Articles, where firſt, in the twenty fifth, they Charged him with three things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That hee had adviſed the King to a rigorous and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exaction of Ship-money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That he had given Councell, that if the Shreeves ſhould deny their beſt endeavors, and aſſiſtances to that effect, they ſhould bee ſent for and fined by the Starre-Chamber, and Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That when the Aldermen of London, had in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity repreſented the Cauſes why the Ship-money could not be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted amongſt them, and had given in the Reaſons why they refuſed to give in a Liſt of their names, within their City, who were able to affoord the Loan-money; Hee in a contemptuous &amp; Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call manner, in the face of the Councell-Boord had ſaid to the King, Sir, Theſe men becauſe of their obſtinacy and frowardneſſe, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very well to bee fined, ranſomed and layed by the heeles: And it will never goe well with your ſervice, untill ſome of them be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for examples to other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proofes were theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Biſhop of London, Lord Treaſurer, who declared that he remembred the words very well, that the Lord Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had adviſed the King to cauſe the Ship-money to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in, but he remembred withall, that both himſelfe and all the Councell had done the like, and that it was upon a preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and defect of money, for entertayning the Army, which (the condition of the times conſidered) they all conceived, was by any meanes to bee kept on foote.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Alderman <hi>Wiſeman</hi> declared, that upon an humble Remonſtrance made to the Councell-Boord, the City would take it ill, if a Tax-role ſhould be delivered of their eſtates, who were thought able for the Loan-money; the Lord Strafford ſaid, they deſerved to bee fined, ranſomed, and laid by the heeles, but for the words of hanging them up, hee heard not at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Earle of Barkeſhire declared, that the Lord Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford had ſaid, that upon the refuſall of ſuch a ſervice enjoyned by the Kings peremptory command, it was his Opinion, they might be fined.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115498:26"/>
            <p> Fourthly, Alderman <hi>Garway</hi> atteſted the preceding words, and withall added, that the Lord Lievetenant, to his beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, had ſaid, It were well for the Kings ſervice if ſome of theem were hanged up.</p>
            <p>They cloſed the Charge, <hi>That by ſuch undutifull expreſſions, he had injured the propriety of the Subject, and had put ſuch d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcontent upon the City, that they were the leſſe willing upon any occaſion to concurre for the advantage of the Kings ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lievetenant Replyed:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That though all the Charge were, in the moſt ſtrict <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply.</note> and rigid way or ſence verified againſt him, yet hee could not conceive by what interpretation of Law it could be rech't home to high-Treaſon, And to that common objection (that the treaſon was not individuall but Accumulative) hee replyed that under favour he thought to that manner, were as much as to ſay, no Treaſon at all: Becauſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That neither in Statute Law, Common Law, nor pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, there was ever, till this time, heard of ſuch a matter as Accumulative-Treaſon, or a Treaſon by way of conſequence, but that it is a word newly coyned to attend a Charge newly invented, ſuch an one as never was before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That treaſon was a thing of a ſimple and ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative nature, and therefore could not be ſo by accumulation, but eyther muſt be ſo in ſome, or eyther of the Articles, or elſe could not be ſo at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hee did conceive that it was againſt the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, and falſe; therefore could not be ſo by Accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but eyther muſt be ſo in ſome or each of the Articles, or elſe could not be ſo at all.</hi> That a heape, or Accumulation, ſhould be and not be of Homo-geneous things, and thrrefore that which, in its firſt being, is not treaſonable, can never confer to make up an accumulative Treaſon, <hi>Cumulus, an heape of Graine,</hi> ſo called becauſe every, or at leaſt ſome of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals are graine; if otherwaies, an heape it may be, but not an heape of graine: Juſt ſo, perhaps theſe Articles may make up an heape of Felonies, Oppreſſions, Errors, Miſ-demeanors, and ſuch like (and to the thinge it ſelfe I ſhall give an anſwere when, under that name, they ſhall be Charged againſt me) but they can no waies conferre to the making up of Treaſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115498:26"/> ſome, at the leaſt, bee Treaſon in the Individuall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the teſtimonies brought againſt him, were all of them ſingle, not two one way, and therefore could not make Faith in matter of Debt, much leſſe in matter of Life and Death; yea, that it was againſt the Statute expreſly, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach a man of high-Treaſon under the evidence of two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous witneſſes, much leſſe to adjudge and convince him upon atteſtation of one.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To the Lord-Treaſurors teſtimony, he did with all his heart condiſcend unto it, but upon theſe grounds only, that there was a preſent neceſſity of money, that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-Boord had ſo voiced with him, yea before himſelfe, and he allwaies thought it preſumption in a man, not to follow the wiſer and more judicious, And that there was then a Sentence of the Starre-chamber, for the right of paying Ship-money; for his part, he would never be more prudent then his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor give judgement againſt the Judges, And therefore he thought it not farre amiſſe to adviſe the King for the collecting of that, which by Law was his owne, in ſuch a preſent and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſity, and although his opinion (and it was no more) had beene amiſſe, he hoped, that though in caſe of Religion, being attended with ſtubbornneſſe and pertinacy, it might come home to Hereſie, yet in his caſe opinion could not reach ſo farre as Treaſon; unleſſe it be Treaſon for a man to ſpeake his judgement freely, when he is upon his oath to doe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For the words about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ining, he had already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in his generall Anſweres to be true, but with theſe qualifications, that it was his opinion only, that it was upon the refuſall (as he conceived) of a juſt ſervice, that hee had ſpoken them, by no meanes to praejudice the Citizens, but to make them the more quick and active in the Kings ſervice: that no ill conſequence at all hapned upon them; that they were words might have beene ſpared indeede, but innocently, though ſuddenly, ſpoken; which he hoped might proceede from a man of ſuch a haſty and incircumſpect humor as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (made ſo both by nature, and his much infirmity of body) without any minde at all to Treaſon, And that if all Cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick expreſſions, of that nature, ſhould bee accounted treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115498:27"/> there would be more ſuits, of that kinde, fly up and down Weſtminſter-hall, then Common-Law.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, To thoſe words atteſted by the Alderman, hee poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denyed them, and hoped they ſhould never riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in judgement, becauſe the teſtimony was ſingle and not poſitive, but only to his beſt remembrance, and that it was exceeding ſtrange, that not any one man, neither of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell or other Aldermen were ſo quick to obſerve them, but only Alderman <hi>Garway,</hi> which he thought ſufficient to nullifie that ſingle teſtimony, except he could demonſtrate himſelfe to have ſome rare and ſingular faculty of hearing.</p>
            <p>In the Cloſe, He deſired the Lords, from his misfortune, to provide for their own ſafety, and ſeriouſly to conſider what a way was chalked out to ruine them, both in their lives and their eſtates, if for every opinion given in Councell, or words ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly or haſtily ſpoken, they (who are borne to weild the great affaires of the Kingdome) ſhould be arraigned and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced as Traytors.</p>
            <p>Then they went to the twenty ſixth Article and Charged thus:</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Firſt, To imbaſe the Coyne, by an allay of copper-money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, To ſeize upon all the Bulloyne in the Mint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That in diſcourſe with ſome of the Aldermen, about that buſineſſe, he had ſaid, the City was more ready to countenance and relieve the Rebells then the King; and that the King of France did uſe to mannage ſuch buſineſſes, not by Treaties or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, but by ſending forth his Commiſſaries to take Accompt of mens Eſtates, accompanied with Troopes of Horſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proofes were.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>Thomas Edwards,</hi> who declared, that in diſcourſe with the Lord Strafford, having remonſtrated unto him, that their goods were ſeized on beyond Seas, becauſe of the mony taken out of the Mint; he told him that if the Londoners ſuffered it, it was deſervedly, becauſe they had refuſed the King a ſmall Loane of money upon good ſecurity, and that he thought them more ready to helpe the Rebels then the King.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> declared that he ſpake ſomething about
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115498:27"/> the King of France, but whether with relation to England or not, hee did not remember.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sir <hi>William Parkiſe</hi> atteſted in the ſame words, and withall that the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> was then preſent, and could declare the whole buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Sir <hi>Ralph Freeman</hi> declared, that in a diſcourſe with the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> hee had ſaid that the ſervants in the Mint-houſe would refuſe to worke the Copper mony, And hee replyed, that then it were well to ſend thoſe ſervants to the houſe of Correction.</p>
            <p>They cloſed the Charge, <hi>That by ſuch undutifull Councell and words, hee had given more then ſufficient proofe, of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and purpoſe to ſubdue this Kingdome, and ſubvert the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Lawes, and priviledges of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Livetenants Reply.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he had expected ſome proofs about the two <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> firſt particulars, but did heare of none, and that it was no ſmall diſadvantage to him, to bee charged with a great many odious crimes, by a booke printed, and flying from hand to hand, through the whole Kingdome, yet when they came to prove there ſhould bee no ſuch thing layd againſt him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, About the Speeches. Hee ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that ſome ſuch thing might perhaps have eſcaped the dore of his lipps, when hee ſaw their backwardneſſe to his Majeſties ſervice, and as the times were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conditioned hee did not think it much amiſſe to call that faction by the name of Rebells, But yet hee thought hee had abundantly ſatisfied for that overſight, (if it was any) at Yorke<hi>:</hi> For having underſtood there that the Citty of London were willing to make a Loan of mony, he there before the great councell of the Peeres, expreſſed himſelfe to this ſence, That the Londoners had ſufficiently made up all their delayes hitherto by their Act, that the King was obliged to their forwardneſſe, and that hee himſelfe ſhould bee as ready to ſerve them as any poore Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in England: About the other words hee ſaid, that being in conference with ſome of the Londoners, there came at that time to his hands a Letter from the Earle of Leiceſter, then at Paris, wherein were the Gazets incloſed, reporting that the Cardinall had given ſome ſuch order, as to leavy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115498:28"/> mony by forces, This hee ſaid hee only told the Lord <hi>Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſtanding by without the leaſt application or intention concerning the Engliſh Affaires, <hi>Cottington</hi> being examined upon this, declared the ſame in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To Sir <hi>Ralph Freeman,</hi> hee ſaid, that his teſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony did not concerne the Charge at all, nor did hee think any thing amiſſe in it, though hee had ſaid it; if the ſervants of the Mint refuſed to worke, according to directions they did deſerve the houſe of correction, nor was it Treaſonable to ſay the King might uſe that houſe for the correction of his ſervants, as well as any man in the Citty for theirs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hee ſaid that there was no great likelyhood that hee had committed reall Acts of Treaſon, when his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party was content to trifle away ſo much time about words, neither was there any Treaſon in them, though they had beene fully verified, and therefore in that (as in all other Articles) hee reſerved a power for his Councell to diſpute in matter of Law.</p>
            <p>They went to the twenty ſeveneth Article and charged thus, <hi>That immediatly after his appointment to bee Livetenant to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charge Article</hi> 27</note> 
               <hi>Army here in England, hee ſhewed what Principles of Arbitrary government lurked within his boſome, for by his own immediate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without and againſt Law, hee had layd Impoſt of mony upon the Kings Subjects, where they mention three particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That hee had impoſed</hi> 8. <hi>d. per diem, upon the County of York, for enterteining the trayne Band, there one whole Moneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That hee had ſent out warrants for collecting the ſame, and threatned to impriſon ſuch as ſhould refuſe to pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That hee ſaid that it was a Crime nigh to the Crime of high Treaſon, Not to pay the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, They added that in his generall Replyes, hee had brought two things for his defence, firſt, that this mony was freely and Voluntarily offered by thoſe in Yorke-ſhire; ſecondly, that the great councell of the Peers had notice of the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the firſt they anſwered that a petition was indeede preferred by the Yorke-ſhire men, and a Moneths pay offered, but that the Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>had refuſed to preſent the ſame upon this exception only, becauſe in the ſame they had petitioned for a Parliament whereby hee evidently declared what little Inclination he had to that way.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115498:28"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>To the ſecond they appeald to all the Lords preſent whether any ſuch order did paſſe, before the Councell of the Peeres at Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proofs were.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Warrant iſſued by Collonell <hi>Pennyman,</hi> for this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and anorher by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r <hi>Edward Osborne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Maſter <hi>John Burrowes</hi> who declared that hee was Clerke to the great councell but did remember of no order, and withall added that it might have paſſed at that time, when he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> attended at Rippon,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Maſter <hi>Dunſton</hi> who declared, that hee had known that mony Levyed by ſome Muſquetiers.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By Sir <hi>William Ingram</hi> who declared that hee had heard the Livetenant ſay, that to refuſe the ſame, came nigh to the Crime of high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>They concluded the Chrage that by theſe particulars, <hi>It was more then evident what unhappy purpoſes and trayterous Deſignes hee had to ſubdue this Kingdome, and ſubvert the fundamentall Lawes and priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To the Petition, That it was a true Petition, drawn <note place="margin">Strafford's Reply.</note> up by the York-ſhire Gentlemen, and as true that hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to preſent the ſame, becauſe of that clauſe about the Parliament, but the matter was thus; At his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to York it was thought neceſſary for the defence of that County, to keep the Trayned Bond on foote becauſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was upon the borders, and therefore the King directed him to write to all the free-holders in York-ſhire, to ſee what they would do for their own defence.</p>
            <p>The time and place were deſigned by the King, but the night before the meeting, a ſmall number convented, and in a private and factious way, did draw up that petition; upon the morrow at their appointed Dyet, in preſence of the whole number, the Petition was preſented to him, where hee did adviſe them to leave out that clauſe, and that becauſe hee knew the King out of his own gracious diſpoſition had intended to call a Parliament, which he deſired ſhould rather be freely done, then upon the conſtraint and Importunity of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, moreover it would ſeeme a mercenary thing in them at one and the ſame time to offer a benevolence, and withall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115498:29"/> to petition for his favour upon this Remonſtrance they were all willing to recall the Petition and directed him by word of mouth, to offer unto the King the moneths pay in their names, which hee did accordingly, in the preſence of fortie of them to their no ſmall advantage.</p>
            <p>This hee proved by Sir <hi>William Pennyman,</hi> Sir <hi>Paul Neale,</hi> Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> Sir <hi>William Savill,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Danby,</hi> who all of them declared as much in ample termes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all added that nothing was done upon better grounds, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and obedience then the offer of that money, and that they never had heard any man grudge againſt it to this time.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, about the councell of Peeres, hee alleadged that hee never made mention of any order of theirs, but hee remembered very well it was twice propounded before them, that the King had approved it at that time a Juſt and neceſſary act, and none of the Councell had contradicted it, which hee conceived as a tacit approbation and an order in Equivalence.</p>
            <p>But though that had not beene, yet there was nothing done in the buſineſſe, but at the ſpeciall deſires of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen themſelves, &amp; for their neceſſary defence &amp; protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea though hee had done it by himſelfe alone, yet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hee had ſo much power by his Commiſſion, cauſing the Commiſſion to that effect to bee read: That albeit he ſhould miſtake his Commiſſion and doe ſome inferiour Act beyond it (becauſe Military proceedings are not allwayes warranted by the Common Law) yet it ſhould not bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as an Act of Treaſon to him.</p>
            <p>And to this effect read a Statute of rhe ſeveneth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond.</p>
            <p>To the Proofs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Collonell <hi>Pennymans</hi> warrant, or Sir <hi>Edward Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornes,</hi> it nothing concerned him, and hee doubted not but theſe worthy Gentlemen could Juſtifie their own Act, and that hee had enough to doe to anſwer his own Miſdemeanors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For Sir <hi>John Burrowes,</hi> hee was at Rippon when that Propoſition was made.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That as the warrant, ſo neither the Execution troubled him at all.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:115498:29"/>
            <p> Fourthly, For Sir <hi>William Ingram,</hi> hee was but a ſingle teſtimony and that ſuch an one too as hee could produce an evidence to teſtifie, hee had miſtaken himſelfe in his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon oath, if it were not to diſadvantage the Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Hee concluded that hee had done nothing in that buſineſſe, but upon the petition of that County, the Kings ſpetiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the connivence at leaſt of the great councell, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a preſent neceſſity for the defence and ſafety of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And ſo much for Wedneſday.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday the Committee for the charge, declared that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thurſday. Charge Sir</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ecarles <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </note> they had done withall the Articles, and were content to wave the laſt for reaſons beſt known to themſelves, only Sir <hi>Walter Earles</hi> added that hee had ſome obſervations to bring forth, upon the two and twenteeth Article which hee conceived might doe much, to prove the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> deſignes for Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iriſh forces in England.</p>
            <p>And they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, That in his Commiſſion hee had power to land them in Wales, or in any part of England, or in Scotland, which were all together ſuperfluous unleſſe there had beene ſome purpoſe for the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That within two dayes before the date of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Letters were ſent to the Lord</hi> Bridgewater, <hi>and</hi> Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke <hi>from Sir</hi> Francis Windebanke <hi>to aſſiſt the Earle of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, in Levying forces for the Kings ſervice, and theſe might bee ſuppoſed to have intended ajoyning with the Iriſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That the Lord</hi> Ranelaugh <hi>at the raiſing of the Iriſh Army, did feare, ſuch a Deſigne as this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, That the towne of Ayre in Scotland, where the Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>pretended he would land thoſe forces, was fortified with a Bulworke, a Garriſon, and Block-houſe which would prohibit landing there, that the Earle of Argiles bounds were divided thence by the Sea, and that the Barr or entrie into the towne, was very dangerous and ſhallow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proofes were only the reading of the Commiſſion grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Livetenants Reply.</p>
            <p>Firſt That his Commiſſion was the ſame <hi>Verbatim</hi> with Northumberlands for England, and that it was drawn up by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115498:30"/> the Councell board heere, and ſent over unto him; So no more deſigne in him then in the Gentlemen of the Engliſh Army, nor no larger then that was put upon him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this was the firſt time hee heard of any ſuch Letters, nor did they concerne him more then any of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That hee was not bound to purge the Lord <hi>Rane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laugh</hi> from all his feares, and that he had his own feares too, which God forbid ſhould be evidence of Treaſon againſt any man, whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it ſeemed the Gentleman had better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from that Kingdome then himſelfe, yet hee would be confident to ſay at Ayre, there was never ſuch a thing as a Block-houſe or Garriſon. But to remove all ſcruples, (for indeede the Roade or landing place is not there ſafe) hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that it was his intention to have landed ſome miles above Ayre, and made only his Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zine of that towne.</p>
            <p>To the Earle of Argiles bounds hee hoped the Gentleman knew, they came not on foot out of Ireland, but had ſhipps to waft and tranſport themſelves and that one of his prime Houſes (Roſneth) was within ſome few miles of the ſame frith.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> finding Sir <hi>Walter Earles</hi> on ground did handſomely bring him off, and told the Lords that all their proofs for that Article were not yet ready, that this was a Superfaetation onely, of the charge, and that in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as the plotting of Treaſon, they muſt be content ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with darke Probabilities.</p>
            <p>Then Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> deſired the Livetenant to reſume his defence, <note place="margin">Glyns <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritable ſpeech.</hi>
               </note> that they might give a repetition of their Charge, and ſo cloſe the proceſſe ſo farre as concerned the matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>Hee replyed that in his caſe all ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ckneſſe is ſpeede enough, the matter touched him narrowly even in his life and eſtate, <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> yea in that which hee eſteemed above them both, his honour and his poſterity, and therefore hee confeſſed hee had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ride poſt in ſuch a buſineſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. That hee knew the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen at the Barre, if they were in his caſe would think the time little enough, except their more able Judgements could ſooner diſpatch the matter in hand, And therefore hee humbly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115498:30"/> intreated that that day might be granted to him for ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe, and recollecting his thoughts and ſpirits, and to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow he would be ready with his laſt Replies for himſelfe, which after a little Ceremony and conteſtation, was condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto by the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>Upon Friday morning, about eight of the clock, the Lievete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">Friday he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from coming by a ſit of the ſtone.</note> of the Tower, and my Lords chamber-Groome came to the Hall, and gave information to the Houſe, upon Oath, that the Lord Strafford was taken with an exceeding great paine, and fit of the Stone, and could not upon any conditions ſtirre out of his Bed.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> Replyed, That it was a token of his willfullneſſe, <note place="margin">Glyn <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
               </note> not his weakeneſſe, that hee had not ſent a Doctor to teſtifie the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Lord Steward made anſwere, that a Doctor could not be had perhaps ſo ſoone in the morning, nor was it poſſible for any Phiſitian to give a certaine judgement concerning a mans diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie by the Stone; Becauſe there is no outward Symptomes that appeare.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> excepted, That if he did not appeare upon Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning, he ſhould loſe the priviledge to ſpeake in his owne defence afterwards, and they permitted to proceede.</p>
            <p>The Lord Steward Replyed, that the Lords had appointed foure of their number to goe to the Tower and learne the juſt cauſe of his ſtay, and if by any meanes he were able, he ſhould be oblieged to come then, if not, Humanity and common equity would excuſe him.</p>
            <q>In the afternoone it was reported that he was dead, of which <note place="margin">

            <p>Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> proffers new proofes concerning the two and twentith Article.</p>
            <p>Upon Satterday morning he preſented himſelfe at the Barre, <note place="margin">Satterday.</note>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115498:31"/> where he expected nothing but repetitions of Charges and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but meane while Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> proffers ſome new proofes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two and twentith Article, which the noble Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, alleaging the Proceſſe was cloſed; Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> anſwered, the Proceſſe is not cloſed, as long as the buſineſſe ſtands unrepea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; And that it did not become a Priſoner at the Barre to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Method of proceeding to the Houſe of Commons in England.</p>
            <p>It was anſwered by the Lord Lievetenant, that he thought it ſtood him in hand as neerely to maintain his life, as it did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to purſue him for it, yet he was willing they ſhould bring in new proofes, provided that he might have time to make new Replies, and withall uſe ſome new witneſſes in ſome Articles, that concerns his juſtification.</p>
            <p>The Lord Newarke, upon theſe motions deſired rhe Houſe might be adjourned; after two houres ſtay, and a hot conflict among the Lords, they returned, and the Lord Steward commanded the Order to bee read, which conſiſted of two Articles.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it was granted unto them to bring in proofes concerning the two and twentith Article, ſo it was to the Lord Strafford to make his Replies, and uſe his witneſſes concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That if they went to no more Articles, no more ſhould the Lord Strafford; but if they did, that hee might pitch upon any one Article as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons preſently declined all other Articles, and conceived the Order expreſly for them, reſtrayning him from all other Articles, except that only.</p>
            <p>He conceived the Order was for him, and ſaid, that ſeeing they had pickt out their Article, it was againſt all common Equity to tie up his hands, and not admit of a common rule for them both; They replyed, that when the Article was canvaſed they reſerved witneſſes till another time; Hee anſwered, that he had done the ſame upon every Article; They Replyed that the Houſe had refuſed his Reſervation; He anſwered, nor had they paſſed an Order for theirs.</p>
            <p>Upon this new conteſtation the Houſe roſe againe, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed. It is ſuppoſed that the Houſe of Commons had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115498:31"/> ground, becauſe they had particularly named their witneſſes in their Reſervation, The Lord Strafford not ſo, they preſſed but one Article, hee many: But ſuch was the pleaſure of the Lords, that though the matter did not deſerve to bee much ſtood upon, yet after two houres vehement agitation of the buſineſſe in the upper-houſe, they returned, and the Order was in his favour to this effect.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That both of them ſhould wave their new ptoofes, and goe immediatly to that which followes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they would not doe ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lords conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves common Judges to both, and therefore would not deny Strafford the liberty of pitching upon what Article hee pleaſed, as they had done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That both of them ſhould name their witneſſes at the Barre inſtantly.</p>
            <p>The Commons were much grieved at this, yet deſired him to nominate his witneſſes, if he would make any benefit of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; He anſwered that he would nominate after them, becauſe they were firſt in order; they replyed that he knew their Article, they not his: He ſaid hee was to bring proofes about the ſecond, fift, thirteenth, and the fifteenth Articles, and did deſire them that they would now proceede to nomination.</p>
            <p>But they told him they could not embrace the Order, without advice of the whole Houſe, then on a ſuddaine, a mighty noyſe followed of the whole Houſe, Withdraw, Withdraw, and was in ſo uncouth and tumultuous a confuſion, that it produced both admiration and feare in the beholders, wherein we might eaſily feele the pulſe of a diſtempered State; both the Houſes brake up, not apointing ſo much as the next Diet, each mans countenance ſpake anger and diſcontent, and nothing ſounded in our eares all Sunday but terrors and affrightments, of a preſent diviſion and breach between the two Houſes; That the Houſe of Commons would declare him a Traytor, and all ſuch Lords too, as were his adherents, That he ſhould be no more heard in publique, That (though parties and not his Peeres) they would vote in his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <note place="margin">Munday ſpent in a conference betwixt botb Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> That a Bill of Attainder ſhould preſently be drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and that nothing could content them but preſent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Big words flew up and down all Monday.</p>
            <p>That whole day was ſpent in a conference betwixt the Houſes
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115498:32"/> without any meeting in the Hall, but the Lords (who had learned as it ſeemes to force their owne ruine by his misfortune, and now conceive that Monarchy and Nobility are of ſuch Identidy, that one and the ſame is the diminution of both (kept faſt to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and would not paſſe from their Order, notwithſtanding all the many dangers repreſented, ſo that the houſe of Commons were conſtrained, at laſt, to give way, and embrace the firſt part of the Order, by waving witneſſes on both ſides.</p>
            <p>This hath beene no ſmall diſcouragement to his Enemies, for a more reall Demonſtration of his party amongſt the Lords, could not have beene ſhewn.</p>
            <p>Upon Monday, ſome of the Lords went ſo high in their heate, as to tell the Houſe of Commons, that it was an un-naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the head to be governed by the tayle, That they hated Rebellion as bad as Treaſon, That the ſame blood that ennobled their Anceſtors, did move alſo in their veines, and therefore they would never ſuffer themſelves to bee ſuppreſſed by a popular faction.</p>
            <p>After a great deale of ſtorme all was (as well as might be) ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up againe, and Tueſday appointed to be the day for the Lievetenant to reſume his Defences, for then their Charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more proofe, to be uſed on eytherſide.</p>
            <p>Upon Tueſday the Lord Steward, at the entrie told them the <note place="margin">Tueſday</note> Lords had Ordered, that both their teſtimonies ſhould be waved that they ſhould proceede immediatly to what followed, ſo that that day might put an end to what concerned the matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>The Lord Lievetenant Replied, That in all humility and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <note place="margin">Straffords Reply.</note> he would ſubmit himſelfe to that or any other their Decrees whatſoever, though it ſhould reach as farre home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as his owne life; but withall humbly begged, That if hereafter hee ſhould be troubled (for they were to ſpeake laſt) with new matter, or with ſupplementall Proofe, hee might have leave to ſpeake ſomething in his owne Defence.</p>
            <p>The Lord Steward anſwered, It was all the reaſon in the world.</p>
            <p>The Lievetenant went on thus:</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:115498:32"/>
            <p> MY LORDS,</p>
            <p>This day I ſtand before you Charged with high-Treaſon, <note place="margin">My Lord Straffords, laſt ſpeech in the Hall</note> the burthen is heavie, yet farre the more, in that it hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the Patrociny of the Houſe of Commons; If they were not Intereſſed, I might expreſſe a no leſſe eaſie, then I doe a ſafe iſſue and good ſucceſſe to the buſineſſe: but let neyther my weakeneſſe pleade my Innocence, nor their power my guilt. If your Lordſhips will conceive of my Defences, as they are in themſelves, without referrence to eyther (and I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor ſo to preſent them) I hope to goe away from hence as cleerly juſtified, as I am now in the teſtimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, by my ſelfe: My Lords, I have all along my Charge watched to ſee that poyſoned arrow of Treaſon, that ſome men would faine have to be feathered in my heart, and that deadly cup of wine, that hath ſo intoxicated ſome petcy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleaged Errors, as to put them in the elevation of high-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in truth it hath not beene my quickneſſe to diſcern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Monſter yet within my breaſt; though now perhaps, by a ſiniſtrous Information, ſticking to my cloathes: They tel me of a two fold Treaſon, one againſt the Statute, another by the Common-Lawe; this direct, that conſecutive; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, that Accumulative; this in it ſelfe, that by way of conſtruction.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I muſt and doe acknowledge, that if I had the leaſt ſuſpition of my owne guilt, I would ſpare your Lordſhips the pains, caſt the firſt ſtone at my ſelf, &amp; paſſe Sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt my ſelfe: And whether it be ſo or not, I refer my ſelfe to your Lordſhips judgement and Declaration: You, and only you (under the favour and protection of my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Maſter) are my Judges, under favour none of the Commons are my Peeres, nor can they be my Judges; I ſhall ever celebrate the providence and wiſdome of your noble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, who have put the keyes of Life and Death (ſo farre as concerns you and your poſterity) into your own hands, not into the hands of your inferiours: None but your own ſelves know the rate of your noble blood, none but your ſelves muſt hold the ballance in diſpencing the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115498:33"/>
            <p> I ſhall proceede in repeating my Defences, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable to theſe two maine points of Treaſon, and for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Statute (which is the only Treaſon in effect) nothing is alleaged for that, but the fifteenth, two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith, and twenty ſeventh Articles. Here he brought the ſum of all his Replies made to theſe three Articles before, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame words as before; only that teſtimony of Sir <hi>Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y Vanes,</hi> becauſe it ſeemed preſſing, he ſtood upon it and alleaged five Reaſons for the nullifying thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it was but a ſingle teſtimony, and would not make Faith in a matter of Debt, much leſſe in a matter of Life and Death, yea that it was expreſly againſt the Statute to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach (much leſſe to condemn him) upon high-Treaſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the teſtimony of two famous witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he was dubious in it, and expreſt it with an as I doe remember, and ſuch, or ſuch like words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That all the Councell of eight, except himſelfe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the words, as if by a ſingular providence they had taken hold of his eares only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That at that time the King had levied no forces in Ireland, and therefore hee could not bee poſſibly ſo impudent as to ſay to the King that hee had an Army there which hee might imploy for the reducing this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, That he had proved by witneſſes beyond all excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (Marqueſſe Hamilton, the Lord Treaſurer, the Earle of Northumberland, Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Sir <hi>William Pennyman,</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Terringham)</hi> that there was never the leaſt intention to land thoſe Forces in England. Hee went on</p>
            <p>So much for the Articles that concerne Individuall Treaſon.</p>
            <p>To make up the Conſtructive-Treaſon, or Treaſon by way of Accumulation; Many Articles are brought againſt me, as if in an heap of Felonies or Miſdemeanors (for in their conceit they reach no higher) ſome prolificall ſeede apt to produce what is treaſonable, could lurke: Here I am charged to have deſigned the ruine and overthrowe both of Religion and State: The firſt ſeemeth rather to have beene uſed to make me odious then guilty, for there is not the leaſt proofe alleaged concerning my confederacy with the Popiſh-faction,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115498:33"/> nor could there be any indeede; never a ſervent in Authority beneath the King my Maſter, was ever more hated and maligned by thoſe men then my ſelfe, and that for an Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and ſtrict executing of the Lawes againſt them.</p>
            <p>Here your Lordſhips may obſerve that the greater number of the witneſſes uſed againſt me, eyther from Ireland or from Yorkeſhire, were men of that Religion: But for my owne Reſolution (I thanke God) I am ready every houre of the day to ſeale my diſaffection to the Church of Rome, with my deereſt blood.</p>
            <p>But, my Lords, give me leave here to poure forth the griefe of my Soule before you, theſe proceeding againſt me ſeeme to be exceeding rigorous, and to have more of praejudice then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that upon a ſuppoſed Charge of my Hypocriſy or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Religion, I ſhould be made ſo monſtrouſly odious to three Kingdomes; A great many thouſand eyes have ſeen my Accuſations, whoſe eares ſhall never heare, that when it came to the upſhot I was never accuſed of them, Is this fayre dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling amongſt Chriſtians? but I have loſt nothing by that: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe was ever nothing in my conceipt, the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and integrity of a good Conſcience, was and ever ſhall be my continuall feaſt; and if I can be juſtified in your Lordſhips judgements from this grand imputation (as I hope now I am, ſeeing theſe Gentlemen have throwne downe the Bucklers) I ſhall account my ſelfe juſtified by the whole Kingdome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by you, who are the Epitomy, the better part, yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soule and life of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As for my Deſigne againſt the State, I dare pleade as much Innocency here, as in matter of my Religion: I have ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the wiſdome of our Anceſtors, who have ſo fixed the pillars of this Monarchy, that each of them keepe a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and meaſure with other, and have ſo handſomly tyed up the nerves and ſinnews of the State, that the ſtrayning of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one may bring danger and ſorrow to the whole oeconomy. The Praerogative of the Crowne, and the Propriety of the Subject, have ſuch mutuall relations, this takes protection from that, that foundation and nouriſhment from this. And as on the Lute, if any one ſtring be too high or too lowly wound up, you have loſt the Harmony, ſo here the exceſſe of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115498:34"/> a Prerogative is oppreſſion of pretended Liberty in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Diſorder and Anarchy. The Praerogative muſt be uſed as God doth his omnipotency, upon extraordinary occaſions; the Lawes (anſwerable to that <hi>potentia ligata in Creaturis)</hi> muſt have place at other times: And yet there muſt be a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, if there muſt be extraordinary occaſions; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Subject is ever to be maintayned, if it goe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall pace with this: They are fellowes and companions that have and ever muſt be inſeparable in a well governd Kingdom; and no way ſo fitting, ſo naturall to nouriſh and entertayne both, as the frequent uſe of Parliaments: By thoſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and acquaintance is kept, betwixt the King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, theſe thoughts have gone along with me theſe fourteene yeerers of my publique employments, and ſhall God willing to my Grave; God, his Majeſty, and my owne Conſcience, yea and all thoſe who have beene moſt Acceſſory to my inward thoughts and opinions can beare me witneſſe, that I ever did inculcate this; That the happineſſe of a Kingdome conſiſts in a juſt poize of the Kings Praerogative, and the Subjects Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that things would never goe well till They went hand in hand together.</p>
            <p>I thanke God for it, by my Maſters favour, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of my Anceſtors, I have an eſtate, which ſo interreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me in the Common-wealth, that I have no great minde to be a ſlave, but a Subject; nor could I wiſh the Cards to be ſhuffled over againe, upon hopes to fall upon a better Set: nor did I ever nouriſh ſuch baſe, mercenary thoughts, as to become a Pander to the Tyranny and Ambition of the greateſt man living: no, I have and ever ſhall aym at a fayr, but a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Liberty, remembring allwaies that I am a free-man, yet a Subject: that I have a Right, but under a Monarch. But it hath beene my misfortune now when I am gray-headed, to be Charged by the Miſtakers of the times, who are now ſo highly bent, that all appeares to them to be in the extreme for Monarchy, which is not for themſelves: Hence it is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, words, yea Intentions are brought out for reall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations for my miſdemeanors, ſuch a multiplying glaſſe is a praejudicate opinion.</p>
            <p>The Articles conteine Expreſſions and Actions: My Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115498:34"/> eyther in Ireland or England: My Actions eyther before or after theſe late ſtirres (in this order he went through the whole Charge, from the firſt Article to the laſt, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Method, and repeated all the ſummes and heads of what was ſpoken by him before, only added in the twenty eighth Article) if that one Article had beene proved againſt him, it conteined more weighty matter then all the Charge beſides: And it had not only beene Treaſon in him, but alſo vilany to have betrayed the truſt of his Majeſties Army. Yet becauſe the Gentlemen had beene ſparing (by reaſon of the times) to inſiſt upon that Article, though it might concerne him much, hee reſolved to keepe the ſame Method, and not utter the leaſt expreſſion that might ſeeme to diſturbe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py agreement intended, though he wiſhed the ſame might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his expectation: only thus much he admired, how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being an Incendiary againſt the Scotts, in the twenty third Article, is now become their Confederate in the twenty eighth Article, or how hee could be Charged for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying New-Caſtle, and for fighting with the Scots at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne too, ſeeting fighting with them was no poſſible meanes for betraying the Towne, but to hinder their paſſage thither.</p>
            <p>That hee never adviſed Warre farther (then in his poore judgement) concerned the very life of the Kings Authority, and the ſafety and honour of his Kingdomes: Nor ſaw hee what advantage could be made by a Warre in Scotland, where nothing could be gained but many hard blowes: For his part, he honoured the Nation, but he wiſhed they might be ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their owne Clymate, and had no deſire they ſhould be too well acquainted with, the better ſoyle of, England: but hee thought that Article had beene added in jeſt, or as a ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary, and he very little ſuſpected to be reaconed a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with the Scotts, and wiſhed (as hee hoped it was) that every Engliſh-man were as free from that imputation as himſelfe [cloſing his Defence with this ſpeech.]</p>
            <p>My Lords, You ſee what may be alleaged for this Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, rather Deſtructive Treaſon. For my part, I have not the judgement to conceive that ſuch a Treaſon is agreeable either with the fundamentall grounds of reaſon, or Lawe; not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115498:35"/> of Reaſon, for how can that be Treaſon in the lumpe or maſſe, which is not ſo in any of the parts? Or how can that make a thing Treaſonable, which in it ſelfe is not ſo: Not of Lawe, ſince neither Statute, Common-Lawe, nor practiſe, hath from the beginning of this Government ever mentioned ſuch a thing; and where, my Lords, hath this fire, without the leaſt appearance of any ſmoake lien hid ſo many hundred yeeres, and now breakes forth into a violent flame to deſtroy me and my Poſterity from the Earth? My Lords, do we not live by Lawes, and muſt we be puniſhed by Lawes before they be made? Farre better were it to live by no Lawes at all, but to be governed by thoſe Characters of diſcretion and virtue, that Nature hath ſtamped in us, then to put this neceſſitie of Divination upon a man, and to accuſe him of the breach of Lawe before it be a Lawe at all. If a Water-man upon the Thames ſplit his Boate by grating on an Anchor, and the ſame have a Buy appending to it, he is to charge his owne Inob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, but if it hath none, the owner of the Anchor is to pay the loſſe.</p>
            <p>My Lords, if this Crime which they call arbitrary-Treaſon, had beene marked by any diſcerner of the Lawe, the ignorance thereof ſhould be no excuſe for me, but if it be no Lawe at all how can it in rigour or ſtrictneſſe it ſelfe condemn me: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware you doe not awake theſe ſleeping Lions, by the ſearching out ſome neglected Moth-eaten Records, they may one day teare you and your Poſterity in peeces: It was your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors care to chaine them up within the Baracadoes of Statutes be not you ambitious to be more skilfull and curious then your fore-fathers in the Art of killing.</p>
            <p>My Lords, it is my preſent misfortune, for ever yours; and it is not the ſmalleſt part of my griefe, that not the Crime of Treaſon, but my other ſinnes (which are exceeding many) have preſented me before this Barre, and except your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips wiſedomes provide for it, it may bee the ſhedding of my blood, may make way for the tracing of yours; You, your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, your Poſterities lie at the ſtake. If ſuch learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as theſe, whoſe tongues are well acquainted with ſuch Proceedings ſhall be ſtarted out againſt you, if your friends, your Councell denied acceſſe unto you, if your profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115498:35"/> admitted to witneſſe againſt you, if every word, Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Circumſtance of yours be ſifted and alleaged as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, not becauſe of a Statute, but becauſe of a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or conſtruction of Lawyers peeced up in an high Rhetoricall ſtraine, and a number of ſuppoſed probabilities: I leave it to your Lordſhippes conſideration to fore-ſee what may bee the iſſue of ſuch dangerous and Recent Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedences.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen tell mee they ſpeake in defence of the Common-wealth, againſt my Arbitrary Lawes, give me leave to ſay it, I ſpeake in defence of the Common-wealth, againſt their arbitrary-Treaſon, for if this latitude be admitted, what praejudice ſhall follow to King and Countrey, if you and your Poſterity, bee by the ſame, diſenabled from the greateſt affaires of the Kingdome; for my poore ſelfe, were it not for your Lordſhips intereſt, and the intereſt of a Saint in Heaven who hath left me here two Pledges on Earth, [At this his breath ſtopt, and he ſhed teares abundantly, in mentioning his wife, which moved his very Enemies to Compaſſion] I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take the paines to keepe up this Ruinous Cottage of mine, it is loaden with ſuch infirmities, that in truth I have no great pleaſure to carry it about with me any longer: Nor could I ever leave it in a better time then this, when I hope the better part of the World would perhaps thinke, that by this my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune I had given a teſtimony of my Integrity to God, my King and Countrey: I thanke God, I count not the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this preſent life compatable to that glory, which is to be revealed in the time to come.</p>
            <p>My Lords, My Lords, my Lords, Something more I had to ſay, but my Voice and Spirits fayle me, only I doe in all humility and ſubmiſſion caſt my ſelfe down before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips feete, and deſire that I might be a Pharos to keepe you from Ship-wrack; doe not put ſuch Rocks in your owne way, which no prudency, no circumſpection can eſchue or ſatisfie, but by your utter ruine; and whether your judgements in my Caſe (I wiſh it were not the Caſe of ye all) be eyther for life or death, it ſhall be righteous in my eyes, and receaved with a <hi>Te Deum Laudamus,</hi> (and then he lifted up his eyes and ſaid) <hi>In te Domine confido, nè confundar in aeternum.</hi>

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:115498:36"/> This hee ſpake with an Imitable life and grace, you have his very words as neere as I can remember, only with ſo much loſſe and detriment as hath periſhed by tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Coppy from his owne mouth, But you deſire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtialitie, and indeede you have it, and with ſome graines too of allowance, for I was ſo affrayd of my own affection to the Gentleman, that I rather bowed to the other extremity, and therefore have ſet down his defences rather to his diſadvantage by my rude pen, then in the native colour, to his eternall glory, and the Confuſion of his Enemies.</q>
            <p>The Repetion of the charge did not ſpend much time, they proceeded orderly Article by Article, in the very ſame words and matter as before, only there were ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flaſhes that paſſed from Maſter <hi>Glyn</hi> (who was the man) in the time of their handling.</p>
            <p>Hee told them that hee ſhould repreſent the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> as cunning in his reylys as hee had beene crafty in his Actions, that hee waved all that was materiall, and inſiſted only upon the Secondary Proofs, that it was more then evident throughout all his charge how hee had endeavored to bring in an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall forme of Government over the lives, the lands, and liberties, of the Kings Subjects, yea had exerciſed a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ever their conſciences too, by the oath adminiſtred in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and though his Malicious Deſignes had taken no effect, yet no thanks to him, but to the goodneſſe of the King and the Vigilancy of the Peeres, had they pleas'd, it had beene too late to have puniſhed him, for no rule of Law had beene left whereby to Cenſure him, after the death and expiration of the Lawes, And if the Intention of <hi>Gvido Faux</hi> might bee thought Treaſon, though the Houſe was not blown up, then this Intention of his may admit the ſame cenſure.</p>
            <p>Hee cloſed that throughout all his defences hee had pretended either warrants from the King, or elſe the Kings Praerogative, and what was this elſe but to draw up a cloude, and exhale the Vapour for the eclipſing of the bright Sonne, by the Jelouſies or Repinings of his ſubjects; if the ſtrength of his piety and Juſtice ſhould not diſpell all theſe miſts and ſend them down to their originall, That the very ſtanding and falling of theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſtood upon this Proceſſe, All of which doe conceive their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115498:36"/> ſafety ſo farre intreſſed in his juſt punniſhment, that no ſetling of their peace or quiet could bee expected, without this, that rhey hoped the Law ſhould never protect him, who had gone about to ſubvert all Law; Nor the Nobility (who had the ſame blood moving in their veines) by ſubmitting themſelves to his baſe Tyranny, looſe that priviledge and liberty, which their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had bought with their deereſt lives. Though there was no Treaſon for his Stat, was it the leſſe Monſtrous? For there was none for ſo many hundreds of yeares that durſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver adventure upon ſuch Inſolencies, to occaſion ſuch a Statute: And were not the fundamentall grounds, and rules, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient to riſe up in Judgement againſt him; without the making a particular Statute: This hee ſaid hee left to the diſpute of the Law and concluded, That ſeeing they had found out the Jonah who theſe many yeares had toſſed and hazarded the Ship of the Common-wealth, with continuall ſtormes and tempeſts, there could no calmes bee expected, but by caſting him out into the Seas, which in all Juſtice they muſt and doe expect from their hands, who are intruſted by the body of the Kingdome to doe the ſame. The Aggravation of the offence hee ſaid, hee had left to Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> who here ſpake that Speech which is now in Print.</p>
            <q>It was a ſport to ſee how Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> in his Speeech was fearefully out, and conſtreined to pull out his papers and reade with a great deale of confuſion and diſorder, before hee could recollect himſelfe; which failing of his Memory was noſmall advantage to the Lievetenant, becauſe by this meanes, the houſe perceived it was a premeditated ſlaſh, not grounded upon the Lievetenants laſt anſwer, but reſolved on before, whatſoever hee ſhould ſay for his own juſtification, but the Lievetenant was nor ſuffered to Reply a word either to <hi>Glyn</hi> or <hi>Pym.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the laſt word muſt bee theirs. And ſo with Tueſday end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter of Fact.</q>
            <p>On Thurſday the diſpute in Law is expected.</p>
            <p>Upon Wedneſday wee were bigg with expectation for the matter of Law, having done before with the matter of fact, but it ſeemes the houſe of Commons had perceived a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their party, and a great increaſe of the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> freinds, in both the houſes occaſioned by his inſinuating, honeſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115498:37"/> and witty defences, and therefore they reſolved of no more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in publique, therefore it was thought upon by his accuſers to draw up a Bill of attainder, and preſent the ſame to the Lords, whereby firſt the matter of fact ſhould bee declared to have been ſufficiently proved, and then in the matter of Law that hee had incurred the cenſure of treaſon, for intending to ſubvert the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, for though (ſaid they) hee cannot bee charged by Letter of Statute of the twenty fift of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. yet hee is within the compaſſe of the <hi>Salvo,</hi> whereby it is provided that the King and Parliament hath power to determine what is Treaſonable and what not, and that they were confident the Lords would ratify, and approve of this Bill of theirs and give Judgement accordingly.</p>
            <p>The motion was ſtoutly oppoſed by three great Lawyers (all members of the Houſe) <hi>Seilden, Holborne</hi> and <hi>Bridgeman,</hi> who made it manifeſt that the <hi>Salvo</hi> 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> 3 was repealed and that no man could now be convict of Treaſon, but by the Letter of that ſtatute: But being put to voice it was carryed for the Bill, and a Committee appointed for to draw it up.</p>
            <p>This gave occaſion of much talke abroad and they who were otherwiſe the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> enemies could not finde equity enough in the Bill of Attainder. Some could not conceive what difference Imaginable was betwixt the Bill and the Charge, preſented before, for in the Charge hee was accuſed of Treaſon; and the Bill (though they had no Legiſlative power,) ſeem'd nothing but an Affirmation of the ſame. Others (who would have the Bill underſtood of a Definitive ſentence, becauſe it was conſecutive to the Proofs) were not ſatisfied but that it was againſt all practice, that the Commons ſhould give ſentence upon the death of a peere And that it was againſt Common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity too; that the party accuſant ſhould give the Judgement, if the complayners were admmitted to bee Judges; A third ſort gave it out that this was no Sentence againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> but only a paſſing of a new act of Parliament about a matter not hitherto declared Treaſonable, but yet theſe doubted that by declaring the matter of fact, to bee approved, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cenſure to it, in reference to the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> it would ever be thought a Sentence againſt him, to blemiſh his own
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115498:37"/> fame and the blood of his poſterity, Moreover that if they were about to make an new act, it were ſtrange to puniſh a man for the breach of ſuch a Statute as was not yet extant in <hi>Rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ,</hi> which ſhould in reaſon referre only to future obedience, And (what is more ſtrange) though there were a new Statute; yet by what Authority the Parliament hath or could declare any Individuall or Accumulative Act which is allready to bee Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, which muſt bee Treaſon by virtue of a Statute; or elſe no Treaſon at all, now there is none can bee brought except the twenty fift of <hi>Edward</hi> the third whereof the Letter of that Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute cannot by their own Confeſſion, nor was not ſo much as once alledged againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford;</hi> and for the <hi>Salvo</hi> or Proviſo (which they mainly inſiſted on) the ſame ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peald by two poſteriour Acts of Parlyament.</p>
            <p>You have the Mutterings of all ſorts of People.</p>
            <p>The Lords fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ring the proceedings as a beaten path troden out to the ruine of their own Lives and Eſtates, told the houſe of Commons in their conference upon Thurſday that they would go on the ſame way they did already, and according to the order of the houſe give full audience to the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> councell in matter of Law, and that they themſelves, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges, would by themſelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s only give Sentence in the cauſe, nor was there any courſe ſuitable to the practice and Stat. of the Kingdome, the ſafety of the Nobility, or to Equity or Common Juſtice.</p>
            <p>It was replyed by them of the lower Houſe, that they were reſolved to go on with their Bill, and if the ſame ſhould bee rejected by the Lords, they feared a Rupture and Diviſion might follow, to the utter Ruine and Deſolation of the whole Kingdom, that no content would be given to the ſubject, (and this was a ſtrong Argument indeed, yet better beſeeming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and violence, then the pretended Juſtice and piety of the times) unleſſe the man who had ſo much intruded vpon their right, and diſcontented the people, might bee puniſhed as a Traytor; And for the practice of the Kingdome, that no man had ever found ſuch a Favourable hearing, and that the Proceſſe againſt Eſſex, Norfolk, and ſomerſet, were all of them cloſed up in one day.</p>
            <p>Upon Friday the Lords gave anſwer that they could expect
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115498:38"/> nothing from the Houſe of Commons, but what ſhould tend to the peace and Preſervation of the Kingdome, nor was there a more forceable way then to preſerve the Lawes and Cuſtomes thereof, leaſt innovation ſo much complained of by them, might unhappily be found among themſelves that the ſubjects ſhould have all that Juſtice could afford, but that an act of Injuſtice would never give ſatisfaction to the world, nor ſafety to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the eyes of all forraigne States being fixed vpon the buſineſie now in agitation, and the wiſdome of our Nation either to bee much advanced or depreſſed by their Judgements in this caſe; That the Proceſſe againſt Norfolk and Eſſex, (for Somerſet was convict only of fellony and had not ſo much Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad verſion to ſave himſelfe by his Booke) were for Direct and formall Treaſons, compriſed in one or two Individuall Acts, but this againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> only Arbitrary and Accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, to bee pict out of the twenty eight Articles. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was impoſſible to have a full examination of them all, to give Sentence againſt him, And thoſe noble men were charged with ſome Actuall breach of Statutes, formerly made, but heere a new Staute was to be made or elſe hee to bee found guiltleſſe, They concluded that they had given order for his appearance on Saterday, And that in the great Hall at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter where the Houſe of Commons might if they pleaſed bee preſent.</p>
            <p>After ſome deliberation with the Houſe, the Conferrers anſwered, that ſince the Lords had ſo reſolved, they would not deny to bee there preſent, and to heare what his Councell could ſay for him, but to reply any more in publique they neither could nor would, becauſe of the Bill allready paſt, only if the Lords ſhould take any ſcruple in the matter of Law, they would bee ready to give them ſatisfaction by a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence, (ſo they willingly declined to doe what indeede they could not poſſibly doe) that is, to give publique ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the matter of Law.</p>
            <p>Upon Saterday they conveened in the great Hall, but they that were of the Committee, for the great charge did not ſtand at the Barre, as before, but ſat promiſcuouſly with the reſt of their fellowes, ſo that a mouth was not oppened in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Houſe of Commons, all that day: After they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115498:38"/> were ſet, the Lord Steward told the Lievetenant, that the Lords had reſolved to give him a faire hearing in the matter of Law, And therefore deſired that the councell might keepe that diſtance, Moderation and reſpect, to the Judicatorie, that was ſitting, and not at all to meddle with the matter of fact.</p>
            <p>The Lievetenant Replyed, That in all humility hee did acknowledge that favour from the Lords, and that it was ſuch an one too, as hee could not but expect from ſuch Honourable Peeres, and Juſt perſons, in whoſe integrity and goodneſſe, (under that which hee had placed above) hee had repoſed his chiefeſt confidence; for his councell they knew much better then himſelfe, what concerned the point of Diſcretion and Reverence, and that hee doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but that they would give all ſatisfaction and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then his Councell were called to the Barre, Maſter</hi> Lane <hi>the Princes Attourney, Maſter</hi> Gardiner <hi>Recorder of London, Maſter</hi> Loe, <hi>and Maſter</hi> Lightfoote: <hi>Maſter</hi> Lane <hi>ſpake, and much to this Sence and Purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords there is an heavy Charge lyeth on me and my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, nothing leſſe then to defend the life, the eſtate, the Reputation, yea the poſterity of this Honourable perſon at the Barre, If therefore wee ſhall bee more preſſing we hope your Lordſhipps will interpret this our forwardneſſe to bee for Honour and Conſcience ſake, in a matter that concerneth both ſo neerely; But it ſhall bee our endeavour to carry our ſelves with our beſt reſpects to your Lordſhips, and withall content and ſatisfaction to the honourable Houſe of Commons, and becauſe your Lordſhips mentioned the matter of fact, one thing I dare bee bold to ſay, that all the time of this Noble Lords defences, hee did not ſo much as crave any one of our opinions, yea or acquainted us with any thing that tended that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115498:39"/> way: And for the matter of Lawe, thoſe Statutes cited by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, were none of our ſtock, but taken up at his owne adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Nor doe I ſpeake this to derogate from the pertinency of thoſe Statutes (for they ſhall be the ſubject of my diſcourſe) but that the Noble-man be not diſappointed of your right concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his own due praiſe.</p>
            <p>My Lords, It is your pleaſure we meddle not with matter of Fact, and indeede we neede not meddle at all with it, becauſe we hope it is already done, and that ſufficiently to our hands, yet the matter of Lawe doth ſo naturally ariſe out of the matter of Fact, that of neceſſity (under your Lordſhips favours) wee muſt ſomewhat grate on this, if we ſpeake of that, nor doe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it poſſible for us to ſpeake advantageouſly enough for the Lord Straffords juſt defence, unleſſe the whole matter of Fact be determined, eyther as proved or not proved, or at leaſt ſome ſtates of queſtions agreed upon, where we may fixe and ſettle our Agreements, and therefore it is my Lords, that I have choſen not at all to touch the matter of Lawe (untill your Lordſhips ſhall be pleaſed to chalke me out a way) unleſſe it be to cleere your judgements in one Statute only, <hi>viz.</hi> 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. becauſe when the ſame was alleaged by the Lord Strafford in his owne Defence, that not being convict of the Letter thereof, he could not be convict of Treaſon: I remember the <hi>Salvo</hi> of that Statute was much inſiſted upon by thoſe from the Houſe of Commons, as much conducing to their own ends. My Lords, I will firſt ſpeake of the Statute it ſelfe, and then of its <hi>Salvo</hi> or Proviſion: The Statute is, (That if any man ſhall intend the death of the King, his Queene, their Children: Kill the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or the Judge upon the Bench, imbaſe the Kings coyne, or counterfeit the broad-Seale, &amp;c. hee ſhall be convicted and puniſhed as a Traytor) that the Lord Strafford comes within the Letter of this Statute is not ſo much as once alleaged, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it cannot bee with any reaſon, All that can be ſaid is, that by Relation or by Argument <hi>a minore admajus,</hi> he may be drawn thither, yet that this cannot bee, I humbly offer theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is a Declarative Law, and ſuch are not to be taken by way of Conſequence, Equity or Conſtruction, but by the Letter only, otherwiſe they ſhould imply a contradiction to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115498:39"/> themſelves, and be no more Declarative-Lawes, but Lawes of Conſtruction, or Conſtitutive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is a poenall Lawe, and ſuch (if our grounds hitherto unqueſtioned hold good) can admit of no Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Inferences, for poenalties are to perſwade the keeping of known Lawes, not of Lawes conjecturall, ambiguous, and by conſequence, which perhaps the moſt learned may not in their diſputes queſtion, much leſſe the Subject (who is not oblieged to interpret the Statute) doubt of in the point of obedience, yea rather without any doubt, hee is to obey the Letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and conceive (and that truly) that hee is not lyable to the Poenalty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have a notable Lawe 13 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 2. whereby it is declared, that the bringing in of Bulls from Rome, to ſtirre up the Subject to Mutiny and Rebellion, ſhall bee puniſhed as Treaſon: Now if by interpretation or by conſequence, this ſence might have beene thruſt upon the praeceding Statutes, the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this had beene ſuperſluous, yea the Perſons then charged with that Crime, might have beene impeached of Treaſon, even before the making of this Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 21 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Wee have a Statute declaring, That for a ſervant to kill his Maſter, is an Act of Treaſon, and in the three and twentith yeere of the ſame King, a Proceſſe of Treaſon was framed againſt a man for killing his Father, grounded upon the ſame Argument <hi>A minori admajus:</hi> But it was found (and the Sentence is yet in the Records) that although in the 21 yeere of <hi>Ed</hi> 3. that Argument might have beene admitted, yet in the 27 it could not, by reaſon of the Declarative Lawe, interveining in the 25 yeere, and this Caſe comes very home to the point in Lawe.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I will not demand what kinde of offence it may be, for a man to ſubvert the fundamentall Lawes of a Kingdome, the Crime doubtleſſe is unnaturall and Monſtrous, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt keepe the ſame proportion, only I preſume to offer theſe few things to your Lordſhips conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That one or more Acts of Injuſtice, whether maliciouſly or ignorantly done, can in no ſence of Lawe be called the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fundamentall Lawes; if ſo, as many Judges (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) ſo many Traytors, It is very incident to mans nature to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115498:40"/> erre, nor doth the Lord Sttafford pleade his innocency in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, but in Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I doe remember the Caſe of <hi>John de la Poole,</hi> Duke of Suffolke, this man in the twenty eighth of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt, was Charged by the houſe of Commons, with Articles of Treaſon, and thoſe too very like to theſe againſt my Lord Strafford.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he had given the King bad advices.</item>
               <item>2. That he had embaſed his Coyne.</item>
               <item>3. That he had ceſſed men of warre.</item>
               <item>4. That he had given out ſummary Decrees.</item>
               <item>5. That he had Impoſed Taxes.</item>
               <item>6. That he had corrupted the Fountains of Juſtice.</item>
               <item>7. That he had perſwaded the King to unneceſſary warre, and to the giving over of Anjoy in France, <hi>Ovum Ovo.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And for all theſe, though he was Charged with high-Treaſon, for wronging the right of the Subject, and ſubverting the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes of the Kingdome, yet after a long Agitation, the matter was found by the Lords of Parliament, not to imply Treaſon, but only Felony. Add to this another, who in the twenty third of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, was Charged for ſubverting the Engliſh Lawes, and yet no Treaſon Charged upon him. Add to both the Charge of <hi>Richard Larks,</hi> pleaded at the Common-Pleas, who was Charged with Treaſon, for ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lawe, but convicted only of Felony, by which you may ſee, My Lords, what to this time hath beene ſubverting the Lawes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is very conſiderable, that the Lord Strafford is not Charged to have ſubverted, but only to have intended to ſubvert the fundamentall Lawes, and this I conceive, if there were no more, might keepe him free from that Statute of the twenty fift of <hi>Edward</hi> the third: For although as touching the King, his Queene and Children, intention is treaſonable; yet in all other things there mentioned, there muſt be action beſide intention, for it is not ſaid, if a man doe intend to kill a Chancellor, it ſhall be Treaſon, but only if he doth kill him; and if hee doth actually counterfeit the broad-Seale, And although a man ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Furnace, make ready his Stampe, melt his Bullion, yet if he gives not the Kings impreſſion vpon the Coyne, all his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea, his praeparations will not ſerve to make up a Treaſon.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:115498:40"/>
            <p> And this (under fauour) may ſerve to anſwere the Caſe of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Faux,</hi> lately objected, unleſſe it be alleaged that the Lord Strafford had as reall an intention againſt the Kings life as <hi>Faux</hi> had,: For though the intention in that Caſe be Treaſon by the Statute, yet in all other things there is no Treaſon without the Action, ſo immence and vaſt a difference both is, and ought to be, betwixt a project againſt the Royall-blood, and all things elſe of a lower and under nature.</p>
            <p>Yee ſee therefore my Lords, that the body of the Statute can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtick againſt the Lord Strafford, neither in Letter, nor in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, this is not, that muſt not be; all that can be ſaid is, that his Fact may be Treaſon by the Common-Lawe: For my part I profeſſe my ignorance, who ever thought the common-lawe might declare, but never make a Treaſon, that is; It might bee preſuppoſed that there is a Statute whereupon to build a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and therefore to ſay there is no Statute for it, is to ſay it is no Treaſon at all. The Statute ever makes the Treaſon: and to be declared to be Treaſon, either by Common-Lawe, or by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, are but two different waies of Proceedings, and muſt both reſolve into one Principle, yea, which comes home to the point, in the one and twentith of <hi>Edward</hi> the third. To kill a man imployed in the Kings Warre was Treaſon, and the twenty third, To kill the Kings Meſſenger was Treaſon by Declaration of the Common-Lawe, but alwaies by reaſon of the Statute, yet none of theſe are now Treaſons but Felonies only, by reaſon of the interveining Statute the twenty fift of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, ſuch hath ever beene thought the force of its Letter and Declaration, And ſo I will leave it, and ſpeake a word or two of the <hi>Salvo,</hi> which is this. That becauſe all Particulars could not bee then defined, therefore what the Parliament ſhould declare to be Treaſonable in time to come, ſhould bee puniſhed as a Treaſon.</p>
            <p>And according to this Reſervative, in the eighth yeere of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, one was Charged before the Kings Bench, was afterward referred to the Parliament, and there, though the Fact was not conteined in the body of the Statute, yet becauſe of the Proviſo afore mentioned, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Treaſon.</p>
            <p>In the eleventh yeere of the ſame King, the Duke of Ireland,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115498:41"/> and <hi>Nevill</hi> Arch-biſhop of Yorke were impeached of high-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by Glouceſter, Arundell and Warwick, and notwithſtanding the Statute, were convicted thereof by the <hi>Salvo.</hi> But in the one and twentith of the ſame <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, the tide turned, and the King had ſuch a hand with the Parliament, that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was recalled, and thoſe three noble-men themſelves adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Traytors. Againe, in the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, that Revocation of the one and twentith of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was repealed, and the Sentence of the eleventh of his Reign eſtabliſhed; ſuch were the toſſings too and fro of Treaſon, and all becauſe of that uncertain <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it was, That in the ſame Parliament, the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, A Petition was preferred by the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to have Treaſon limited within ſome Statute.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they knew not what to ſpeake or what to doe, for feare thereof, And in the tenth Chapter an Act was made, upon this Petition, that that <hi>Salvo</hi> ſhould be holden Repealed in all times to come, and nothing eſteemed Treaſon but what was Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally conteined in the Statute of the twenty fift of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and therefore it is ſaid in the Records, That there was great joy at the making of this Act, in that the drawn Sword hanging over every mans head, by this ſlender thred of a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or illation, was moved by that Act. Add to this, that in the firſt of queen <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the firſt chapter, the ſame is repeated, That no man ſhall be puniſhed in life or eſtate as a Traytor, but for the Crime conteined in the Stat. 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. without the leaſt mention of a pretended <hi>Salvo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of Northumberlands Caſe comes nigh to the point, he was Charged with Treaſon, the fift of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and if the Statute of the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the firſt chapter, whereby this Proviſo is Repealed had not interveend, no doubt he had beene condemned of Treaſon, but he was only convict of Felony, and that becauſe he could not be drawne within the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Statute of the twenty fift of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, And I dare confidently ſay it, that ſince that Act was made, the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the firſt chapter, whereby the Proviſo is Repealed, no man hath ever beene declared a Traytor, eyther by King or Parliament, except it were upon that or ſome other Statute, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and declaratively taken. Theſe two things I doe offer to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115498:41"/> your Lordſhips conſiderations. That the Lord Strafford cannot be impeached of Treaſon by the Statute of the twenty fift of <hi>Ed.</hi> the third, and that the <hi>Salvo</hi> conteined in the ſame, ſtands Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed almoſt two hundred yeeres agoe, And this is all I conceive to be neceſſary for that Statute which was alleaged by the Lord Strafford in his Defence for matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>Then the Recorder ſpake ſome few words to this purpoſe, That <note place="margin">The Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> what was ſpoken upon the Statute; was becauſe it ſeemed inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the matter of Fact, that they could proceede no further till a State were afforded them, that to doe otherwiſe they conceived might bee very praejudiciall unto my Lord Strafford.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In that they ſhould ſuppoſe that to be done, which is not proved to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the matter of Law ariſeth ſo naturally from the matter of Fact, that it will be impoſſible to ſeparate one from the other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it is the courſe of all Judicatories, firſt to ſettle the Verdict. and upon that to fixe the Arguments, otherwiſe hee could conceive no poſſible way of proceeding, And therefore, in the Lord Straffords name, he moſt humbly entreated, that the Lords would either wholly determine the matter of Fact (or whether Treaſon or not; for then all other proceedings in Lawe were unneceſſary, but whether done or not done) or elſe to give them ſome States of the queſtion whereunto they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themſelves.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Upon this motion the Houſe was adjourned for that day, nor hath it met ſince, for the Houſe of Commons are turned to their old bias, and will heare of nothing but the Bill of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the Lords ſeeme to be more reſolute then before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they finde that they have no Authority to declare a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a fact already paſt, the <hi>Salvo</hi> of the twenty fift of <hi>Edward</hi> the third being Repealed, withall that if the Bill of Attainder ſhould proceede, the King hath as great power to hinder that at the laſt blow as any other Stat. but I hope the Lords will disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him of that envie.</p>
               <p>All they which ſtand oblieged to the Lord Strafford, in blood affection, or deſerving, and all who have beene intereſſed with him in the Kings ſervice, and many too, who both hate his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115498:42"/> and diſlike his proceedings, will doubtleſſe looke to it, and tender their owne ſafety, all of them in likelyhood being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Charge of Treaſon if ever they chance to be called to doe the King ſervice in any place of importance.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſſe how much the voice of the multitude is now altered from what it was lately, nothing now talked of what ſhould be done, but only of what muſt be done: ſo that if the Lord Strafford dies, his very enemies will confeſſe that it is done more for neceſſity then for Juſtice, and rather for the ſatisfaction of rancorous apprehenſions, then for any guiltineſſe in the Cauſe.</p>

            <p>The Speech is in Print.</p>
            <p>If it were not without my Sphere to give my opinion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>St. Johns</hi> ſpeech, it ſhould be this, That he ſpake little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe, except in his fift or ſixt Arguments, and in them, I beleeve without his booke, if not, I ſhould conceive it better and ſafer to live under the Lawes of any other Nation then theſe of England, where all Lawe is, at laſt, reſolved into an Arbitrary power, and that by theſe very men, who ſo much elſewhere enveigh againſt it: Of the Preſidents which ſeeme to

            <p>The next news which we expect to heare is, with what Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he went out of this World, for it is concluded amongſt the major part of his Judges, that one muſt die for the people, It were well if the blood of one two or three could ſatisfie. The Bill, for certain, is paſt the higher Houſe, to which 'tis thought the King will be perſwaded to give way: The Scaffold is built upon the Tower Hill, God grant him mercy for his other ſins, and I hope he will eaſily anſwere that of Treaſon; He dies, as we heare, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the twenty third Article, for the words atteſted by Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> though his Majeſty publiquely proteſted the words were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoken by him.</p>
            <p>Upon the cloſe of Maſter <hi>St. Johns</hi> ſpeech the Houſe diſſolved, nor was there a word ſpoken but by Maſter <hi>St. Johns,</hi> only the Lord Lievetenant uſed the laſt part of his Rhetorique, and by a dumbe eloquence, <hi>Manibus ad Syderatenſis,</hi> all along Maſter <hi>St. Johns</hi> ſpeech, made his Replies with a deepe ſilence.</p>
            <p>Upon Friday he Petitioned the Lords to be heard againe, and that becauſe his Lawyers had not fully ſpoken at their laſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but this was denied him, becauſe the Houſe were to have the laſt ſpeech, nor were they content to ſpeake againe.</p>
            <p>Upon this information, or what elſe is not known, the King (it ſeemes fearing the Inconſtancy of the Lords) came to the Houſe on Saterday, at ten of the clock, and having called for the Houſe of Commons ſpake much to this effect.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there was never ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nor had the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> ever offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch adviſe, for the tranſporting of the Iriſh Army into England; ſo that in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the Livetenant had beene more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood then in that: Which imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did, in no ſmall meaſure, reflect on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (the King) as if he had intended to make War upon his own good Subjects, which thought (he ſaid) was farre enough from his breſt; nor could any man in probability thinke ſo unworthily of him, who had perceived how graciouſly he had dealt with his Subjects elſewhere, that had deſerved a great deale worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Lievetenant had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver advized him to eſtabliſh an Arbitrary Government; nor, if he had, ſhould he have eſcaped condigne puniſhment; nor would any of his good Subjects ever think otherwiſe, unleſſe they conceived him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee a foole or a Tyrant; that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not, or would not diſcern ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115498:43"/> wickedneſſe. Hee was well content (hee ſaid) with that Authority and Power which God had put into his hands; nor ſhould he ever thinke it his Praerogative to intrude upon the Propriety of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For himſelfe and his own Conſcience (hee ſaid) he was now to Declare; That in his own judgement there was nothing in the Proceſſe againſt the Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant that deſerved the cenſure of Treaſon: Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights and Miſ-demeanors there were, in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he confeſſed the Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worthy hereafter to beare any Office in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, no not ſo much as of a Conſtable; but was to be anſwerable for all his Errors when they were to be charged upon him, and to this none of them ſhould concurre with greater alacrity then himſelfe; That he hoped none of them would deny to give him the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the firſt Voice, which was, That he would never, in heart nor hand, concurre with them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this man as a Traytor, and deſired therefore that they would thinke of ſome other way how the buſineſſe might be compoſed; Nor ſhould it ever be leſſe deere to him (though with the loſſe of his deereſt blood) to protect the Innocent then to puniſh the Guilty.</hi>

               <p>At the Houſe of Commons ſtartled, and adjorned themſelves till Monday, divers cenſures are Paſt upon the Kings ſpeech, even of thoſe that love his houour, ſome thinke hee was drawn to this by a certain fore-knowledge of the Lords facility to give way to the Commons, and that it was better to expreſſe themſelves then, (if by that meanes hee could hinder the ſentence) then to countermand the Execution thereof when it was paſſed, and ſo draw all the envie upon himſelfe, others are of opinion (which is more probable) that this hath beene a plot of the Kings boſome enemies, to ſet him at ods with his ſuj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon is, becauſe it is very likely the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> might have paſſed free by the voices of the Lords, but now howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the matter falleth out, all the blame will be imputed to the King, for if hee bee condemned, it will bee no thanks to the King; if Juſtified, that will cerrtinly bee layed to the King too, as who by his threats and menaces hath foreſtalled the voyces of his Nobilty; It is conceived by wiſe men (and ſuch as wiſh no evill to my Lord <hi>Strafford)</hi> that it had beene farre better both for the King and him: to have firſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the utmoſt of the Lords; for the King, becauſe it was both poſſible and probable that hee migh have gayned the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lords for him, If not, it was time enough to Interpoſe his own power afterwards; for the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> becauſe it hath made the Houſe of Commons a great deale the more preſſing fearing by the Kings Peremptorie anſwer (from whom in regarde of the advantage of the times, they expected nothing but a <hi>Concedimus omnia)</hi> that there is ſome plot under hand. And theſe thoughts produced the late tumults of the Londoners of which more by and by, And it is verily thought that for theſe two reaſons the Lievetenants ſeeming friends, but indeede Reall enemies, have put the King upon this way hoping thereby that the Lords ſhould finde occaſion to pretend neceſſity of doing that, which perhaps in regard of common equity, or the Kings dipleaſure they could nor durſt have done, howſoever <hi>Facta est alia,</hi> the King is now ſo farre engaged, that with reſpect to honour and conſcience hee connot retire, for if the Praecedure bee

               <p>This hath produced Strange alterations, even the marriage of the Prince of Orenge, (done on Sunday laſt, May the ſecond, with ordinary Solemnity) is now exceedingly hatefull to the Commons, which ſo much before deſired it; ſome ſay the Praecipitation of that marriage Imports no good; others that the Parliament had condiſcended to that marriage, but did not expect that Acceleration; a third ſort, that the party is meane enough if not too lowe for the King of Englands eldeſt Daughter, All of them; that the Dutch-men have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mony to the King for a new ſervice of warre, and have thereby bought this Honour, This is encreaſed by the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Dutch-man who is to bee Gentleman of the Kings Horſes: And ſhortly with us the Hollander will bee no leſſe odious then the Spanyard.

               <p>Before I tell you of Monday and Tueſdayes madneſſe, I muſt tell you when and whence this fury hath its firſt motion.</p>
               <p>Upon the Thurſday before, a great many Apprentiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors houſe neere Biſhops-gate, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to pull it downe, and kill the man; the Mayor of London coms amongſt them, and with a great deale of paynes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to retire home, and afterwards entred into the Ambaſſadors Houſe, at his comming in, the Ambaſſador de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115498:45"/> him to pull downe his ſword which was carryed before him, becauſe hee was now where the King of Spaine had Juriſdiction; That being done hee told the Lord Mayor that in all his life time hee had never ſeene ſuch a barbarous attempt, and deſired to know whether England were a civill Nation or no, where the Law of Nations were ſo monſtrouſly violated, The Mayor replyed that they were of the baſe and raſcally ſort of people, and intreated the tumult might not bee imputed to the town, the Ambaſſador anſwered that hee could hardly acknowledge that to bee a town, yea ſcarce a ſociety of men where there was ſo little Civility and Government. The Mayor told him that the people were diſcontent becauſe Maſſe was ſaid in his houſe, The Ambaſſodar replyed, that the Engliſh Ambaſſador; had the free exerciſe of his Religion at Madrid, and that hee would rather forgoe his life then any of thoſe priviledges due to him by Paction, and the Law of Nations. The Mayor anſwered, they were the more incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him, becauſe the Londoners popiſhly affected, were permited to come into his houſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The ſtorme was quiet from thence till Munday, when the people being inflamed agayne, by the Kings ſpeech, came to Weſtminſter with the number of five or ſix Thouſand having weapons and battoones in their hands, at the entering of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Coach ſome cryed Juſtice others execution, a third man told his fellows that both were to be conjoyned, and that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice &amp; execution was the noble word; upon which <hi>(quaſi da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſigno)</hi> all the rabble cryed aloud with one voice Juſtice and Execution, with a wonderfull ſtrange noiſe, ſome went to the Coach ſide and told the Lords that they muſt &amp; would have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done upon the Deputy. In particular above 1000 of them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115498:45"/> beſet the Lord Stewards Coach; and demanded Juſtice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of him, Juſtice, ſaid they, wee have gotten allready and wee only deſire (and muſt have it) Execution. The Lord <hi>Steward</hi> replyed they ſhould have Juſtice and Execution, and deſired them only to forbeare and have patience a while; no ſayd they wee have had too much patience, wee will not ſuffer longer, and therefore my Lord before you goe from us you muſt grant us execution, the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> told them hee was going to the Houſe to that effect, and that they ſhould have all content, But whileſt they were about to deteine him longer, ſome of the greateſt power amongſt them ſayd, wee will take his word for once and with difficulty enough made paſſage for him.</p>
               <p>The Lords Stayed within till twelve of the clock, nor was there any courſe taken in the meane time for diſſolving of the multitude, the greateſt part went home the back way by water, onely when the Lord Holland, Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and Briſtowe, came out to their Coach, all of them called Juſtice and Execution, but when thy perceived that Briſtowe was in the Coach they drew neere to the Coach ſide and told him, for you my Lord Briſtowe wee know you are an Apoſtate from the cauſe of Chriſt, and our mortall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wee doe not therefore crave juſtice from you, but ſhall (God willing) crave juſtice upon you and your falſe ſonne the Lord <hi>Digby.</hi>

               <p>After this they drew up all the names of thoſe either in the Houſe of Commons, or the Houſe of Lords.

               <p>They have further threatned that after Wedneſday they will ſhut up their ſhopps, and never reſt from petitioning, till not only the Livetenants matter, but alſo all things elſe that concerne a Reformation, bee fully perfected.</p>
               <p>The houſe of Commons ſat all that day, (Munday) till <note place="margin">Monday Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 8 at night, nor were they Idle all that time, but brought forth that Proteſtation, or band of Aſſociation (as they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115498:47"/> terme it) which is now in print, it was then drawun up, and without further proceſſe or delay before they came out ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the whole Houſe, except the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and an Uncle or Friend of his.</p>
               <p>It is thought by ſome (whoſe heads are not green) that it is very like a Covenant in Scotland, but that muſt bee left to furrher time and wiſer heads, if that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment that perhaps will follow, bee not worſe then the text, it may in probability happen out to bee canonicall enough, but the too generall Phraſe in it, lyes very open to have ſences <hi>(pro re natâ)</hi> thruſt upon them, which may, bee very juſtly ſuſpected to have beene intended; where the oath and Law-giver, is the party, only ſome have obſerved two remarkable things upon this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some thinke it Strange that Seeing the Houſe of Commons have lately fined the Convocation Houſe, upon this ground eſpecially that they enjoyned an oath, which is a Legiſlative power (ſay they) and only due to Parliaments How they at this time, (as if all the Legiſlative power were in them) without the adviſe of the Lords (I ſay not of the Church, though in matters Eccleſiaſticall) or approbation of the King (which is conceived to bee a mighty encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his Praerogative) ſhould offer either to praeſcribe, or ſubſcribe ſuch an oath as if it were eſſentiall to our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ever to bee done by the people, without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Superiour powers, and yet before it paſſe in a Stat. It muſt come in by a Bill <hi>usteron proteròn,</hi> but parhaps it is hoped that by this Anti-dated ſubſcription, they ſhall finde out the more eaſy paſſage for the Bill when it comes to bee Propounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Houſe of Commons were foure houres pleading, upon that one expreſſion in the Proteſtation, <hi>[The true reformed Religion expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of England]</hi> Some who were more tender toward the Church, deſiring that the word diſcipline, might bee adjoyned to the word Doctrine, but others mainly oppoſed that, reaſoning that no diſcipline could bee admitted but all to bee eſteemed as Popiſh that was not conteined in the Doctrine, that is in the word of God, which party at the laſt did prevaile though
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115498:47"/> the other affirmed that there was more expreſſe warrant in the word of God for Biſhops, then for ruling Elders, but if ſome Hint bee not there intended againſt the Duanes and Chapters the liturgies, &amp; ceremonies, yea the very Biſhops of the Church of England, let any man judge, and of what dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that may bee, if thoſe who pretend to have authority in all Church affaires, may bee permitted to give Sentence is not difficult to determine.</p>
               <p>This day the people mett againe but in ſmaller number, they have threatned to come to morrow with all rheir maine forces, and not to deſiſt till the Lievetenant bee executed, and their other petitions obteined, the oath was likewiſe preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lords, and ſome ſay all of them (except the eight Recuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt Lords, and foure of the Biſhops) have ſigned the ſame, but others ſay they have only admitted the Bill which is more likely. I think it is <hi>Lncan</hi> tells us the tale, That when the 100 handed Gyant <hi>Briareus</hi> (whom the Mithologizers of Poems uſe as a Type of the multitude) was firſt brought into the world, his Father <hi>Jupiter</hi> deſired <hi>Mercury,</hi> to ſet his Scheme, and calculate the Starres of his Nativity; no Father ſaid <hi>Mercury;</hi> that is needleſſe, a little time will ſhew his diſpoſition, for ſo many hands cannot bee long Idle; A very lively Idoea of this buſineſſe now in Agitation, your ſelfe may make the application by the events.</p>

            <p>Upon Saterday, May the eighth, the Bill againſt the Lord <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Saterday May</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>Strafford</hi> paſt the Lords, there were fourtie five preſent, of which nyneteene voiced for him, and twenty ſix againſt him, the greateſt part of his friends abſented themſelves upon pretence, (whether true or ſuppoſitious) that they feared the multitude, otherwiſe his ſuffrages had more then counterpoiſed the voters for his death.</p>
            <p>In the Bill hee is condemned of Treaſon, and all his Engliſh Lands (the other part of the Coat is left for thoſe in Ireland) forfeited, with an eſpeciall Proviſo, that this Act ſhall in no waies bee forceable againſt others, then if it never had been made; which to his friends of Judgment ſmells Strongly of a particular hatred againſt him, as if the ſame common way of Juſtice ſhould not equally ſtrike againſt all (which it ſhould doe in true Juſtice) but that Crimes did differ in their Subjects.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:115498:48"/>
            <p> Two wayes there were to have proceeded againſt him, by a Legiſlative, or by a Judiciary power, both did ſtrike home alike at his life and his eſtate, both alike ready, both ſure by reaſon of the proofs, the Difference only this; this might have beene done without the King, that only by him, becauſe this a Sentence, that a Statute; A man would think the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary way had beene the more ſure, and that the King would rather have connived, and not exerciſed his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative by a Reprivall, then to have Intereſſed himſelfe in the Legiſlative proceedings, by conſenting to the Act againſt him; In whom the world conceived (for by paſt and future ſervices) he had ſo great an Interreſt: But they (it ſeems) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Majeſties late Atteſtation, of the Gentlemans Innocency in point of Treaſon, were more confident of his gracious Inclination to Juſtifie their own Act; And more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous too that hee ſhould demonſtrate his willingneſſe in puniſhing ſuch tranſgreſſors, and therefore the Bill went on by the Statute.</p>
            <p>The ſame day another Bill paſſed both the Houſes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the important buſineſſes of the Kingdome, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould not be broken up by the King without the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call adviſe and conſent of both the Houſes, till all their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances were redreſſed and their ſafety provided for, which ſpace of time, for any thing I know, may laſt till doomes day; ſome would have had the prefinition of 5, ſome 7, ſome 9, yeares put to it; others Replyed that this would bee both odious &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; odious in that it ſhould ſeem ſo long a Parliament; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, in the ſame time may happen out poſſible to be longer; ſome think it an honor (I rather a fatality, or to ſweeten the word a Providence) that both their Bills ſhould paſſe at once, as if <hi>[Generatio unius,</hi> were <hi>Corruptio Alterius.]</hi> And this new Governwent ſhould take life from the death of the Earle of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the afternoone the Houſe of Commons deſired acceſſe to the King in the Banqueting Houſe, and having ſtayed there an houre for his coming, in three words they propounded theſe two great Bills, deſiring that hee would give his Royall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them both, <hi>(Quod ſi non proſint ſingula, Juncta Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant)</hi> Withall humbly ſhewing that the preſent danger of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115498:48"/> Kingdome could admit of no delayes, The King told them they ſhould expect an anſwer on Munday morning.</p>
            <p>The Court at this time was ſurcharged with a confluence of People, <hi>quaſi Civitas tota ſedibus ſuis mota,</hi> as if the whole Citty was come to petition for Juſtice, a Government indeede worſe then a Democraſie, where the people doe not rule but play the Tyrants, If there were no Monarchy there needs no conſcience to obay it; But where it is, and cannot protect it ſelfe, the good ſubject muſt either forget himſelfe, or his loyalty; A two edged ſword killing either the body or the ſoule, nor in this are men in better eaſe then the winged Fiſhes, that our Southerne Mariners tell us of which, if they ſwim beneath the water are cath'd by the Dolphin, if they fly above for refuge, are ſnatched away by the hungry Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous foules, (Lord helpe then the times, or help our patience, and Reſolutions, give us either redreſſe in thee, or confidence in thee.)</p>
            <p>The wiſer ſort conceived theſe two Bills too big for them to deſire at once, and that both of them together might procure a flat deniall, but the more couragious knew the readyer way by farre, having often had experience of his Majeſties readineſſe to grant juſt deſires; reſolving that hee that expects to looſe the day, is beaten at his own diffidence, and it is the qualitie of ſome men to ſwallowe Camells upon a ſudden, who (if you give them leiſure, will perchance ſtreine at a Gnatt. Their Reſolutions may ayme at this but deſpaire to remedy that, nature gives the reaſon, <hi>Omne agens ſe exercet, intra ſphaeram Activitatis,</hi> dangers if they come but ſtragling upon us wee may collect our ſpirits well enough, and eaſily reſiſt them, but if they come by whole troopes Amazement and feare admitts of no conſultation for the future, but only intends to decline the preſent and preſſing hazard, whereon the ancient Gaules made their firſt on-ſetts, with valour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the courage of men; and with fearefull cryings and ſhouts belying rheir own Animoſity, to ſtupify and quell that of the enemy.</p>
            <p>Sunday, All the day the King was reſolute never to give <note place="margin">Sunday.</note> way to the Bill againſt the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> telling them withall that it ſeemd ſtrange to him, that the man could not dy, unleſſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115498:49"/> hee, and hee only by giving Sentence the Kings Legiſlative way ſhould condemne him, the Lord <hi>Pembrok</hi> brought the King a piece of Scripture, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. from the 5. to the 9. verſe, the words indeede became a Joab rather then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe till hee had ſcattered the force of the Kings (not eldeſt ſonne yet eldeſt) daughter, the Kingdome of Scotland; heere is ſome Analogy with <hi>Abſolon</hi> and in nothing elſe, for <hi>David</hi> was ſorry for ſhedding the nocent, they not ſorry for ſhedding the Innocent blood, though the Iſſue bee not the ſame.</p>
            <p>Foure Biſhops were ſent for by the King, the Primate of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Biſhop of Durham, Lincolne and Carlile, ſome <note place="margin">Foure Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> ſay (and I doe rather believe it) that the King was deſirous the Bill ſhould bee voiced againe, and argued, the Biſhops had their ſuffrages in the Admiſſion though not in the approbation of the Bill, others thinke in regard the Primate was there, (who had no Intereſt in this Kingdome) it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Kings Conſcience; for my part I ſee not how they ſhould doe this, ſeeing the buſineſſe was grounded upon a caſe in Law, which none of them (unleſſe the Biſhop of Lincolne had learned when hee was Lord Keeper) could poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe; for if the King was tender in it, how could they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to give way, if not, what needed their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>But it may bee that they perſwaded him, that in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee might preferre the opinion of the Judges before his own, And that if (though with ſome reluctation) they thought upon their oathes, the Proceedings to bee lawfull, hee might give way to them, This is not unlikely becauſe the judges were ſent for the ſame time, and it ſeems for the ſame ſervice, And if it bee ſo; I admire, (and adore too) the wonderfull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who in his praeparatory Act, to his unlawfull Judgment (which undoubtedly will follow) ſuffers not only the King and the Countrey, but the Church too, (as if her Cup were not yet full) to be involved.</p>
            <p>But could this bee to the matter of fact, the King I am ſure knew him to bee free from any the leaſt intention of ſubverting the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, And could the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſatisfie thi ſcruple too, it may bee they are perſwaded, that the Proofs might bee taken Implicitly from the Houſe of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115498:49"/> Commons, as the Law from the Judges; It is reported indeed that they beſought the King with many teares to give way, and that to prevent the ruine of the Kingdome, which theſe Stateſ-men (who will bee ever content with the longeſt life for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, till by peece meale they bee thruſt from all) did ſee would neceſſarily follow<hi>:</hi> well, I dare propheſie to them they ſhall not want their Reward, neither from King nor people, for the next tumult of people ſhall bee againſt their Liturgies, Surplices, and Church ornaments. And ſeeing they have now over-perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King in this, if they can procure him then to protect themſelves, from thoſe imminent dangers which hang over their heads, they ſhall doe a miracle. <hi>ſed quos pordere vult Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, dementat.</hi> ſome body elſe will perſwade the King that to ſatisfie the Common People, and to prevent the Ruine of the Kingdome, Biſhopricks, Deanes, Prebends, and all Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals muſt down, <hi>Sedomen avertat Deus optimus.</hi>

            <p>Two obſervable Expreſſions I had from an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Auditor,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>George Wentworth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> weeping extremely upon the Scaffold, was thus checked by him: Brother, what doe you ſee in me that deſerves theſe teares? doth my feare betray my guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? or my too much boldneſſe any Atheiſme? Thinke now (and this is the third time) that you doe accompany me to my Marriage Bed: Nor did I ever throwe off my cloathes with ſuch freedom and content, as in this my preparation to my Grave, That Stock [pointing to the block appointed for his Execution] muſt be my pillow; here muſt I reſt, and reſt from all my labors; no thoughts of envie, no dreames of Treaſon, Jealouſies of foes, cares for the King, the State or my ſelfe ſhall interrupt this nap; therefore Brother, with me, pitty mine enemies, who beſide their intention have made me bleſſed; rejoyce in my Innocency, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in my Happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Kneeling downe upon the Scaffold hee made this Proteſtation, I hope Gentlemen you doe think that neither feare of loſſe, nor love to Reputation will cauſe me to bely God and my owne Conſcience, for now I am in the dore going out, and my next ſtep muſt be from time to eternity, eyther of Peace or Payne; to cleere my ſelfe to you all, I doe ſolemnly proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, I am not guilty (ſo farre as I can underſtand) of that great Crime laid to my Charge, nor have ever had the leaſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115498:51"/> or intention to damnify or praejudice the King, the State the Lawes or Religion of this Kingdome, but with my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to ſerve all, and to ſupport all <hi>[So might God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his Soule.]</hi> His words did juſtifie him more there then in Weſtminſter Hall, and made ſuch a deepe impreſſion in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that a great many of thoſe who cryed out for Juſtice againſt him (after their fury was ſpent, and their madneſſe ſtrewed with cold blood) wiſhed their tongues had beene cut out of their heads before they had opened their mouthes againſt him; others moſt ignobly imputed this to his effronted boldneſſe, and are ſo perſwaded of their own infallibility, that they mervailed he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not his Actions to be Errors vpon their Word, and did not confeſſe their opinions of him to be truth it ſelfe; A kinde of People they are beyond the cure of Bedlam, and nothing but the whipping poſt, or letting blood can doe them good, or bring them remedy, <hi>Vexatio tantum dabit Intellectum,</hi> 'tis nothing but ſence will teach them judgement, and affliction Charity, and both theſe I feare are haſtning on apace.</p>
            <p>His Countenance was in a middle poſture, betwixt dejection and boldneſſe, a man may call it, even courage and Innocence it ſelfe, without any feare of Critticks, nor could his very Enemies through their multiplying glaſſes, perceive the leaſt affectation of diſguiſe in him; never man looked death, more ſtately, in the face; never man trembled more at his ſinnes, ſuch were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritions for his overſights, and ſuch his immovable confidence of Gods Pardon and his Mercy.</p>
            <p>His Prayers raviſhed all the ſtanders by, that they could not judge whether to preferre his zeale or his poenitency; yea, the Primate of Ireland (who is no complementer) reported after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the King, that he had then firſt learned to make ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations aright to Godward, and withall told his Majeſty that he had ſeene many die, but never ſuch a white Soule (this was his owne expreſſion) returne to 'its maker; At which words the King was pleaſed to turne himſelfe about and offer a teare to his Memory.<hi>—Tantorum mercede laborum.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe miſ-report, about him and my Lords-Grace of Canterbury, hath wandred as farre as Cambridge, give me leave to adde the ſtory of that miſtake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was reported here by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulgers of ſuch ſlanders, that a little before his death, he had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115498:52"/> all his misfortunes, overſights and miſdemeanors upon the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury, as the prime Author, and had bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly curſt the day of their firſt acquaintance; A pretty inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was, to charge the Axe againe, and to furniſh the People with lungs and voices to cry for another Sacrifice; yea, to ſtaine this Martirs long white Robe, with the Innocent blood of another <hi>Heroes. Oh yee ſonns of men! How long will yee love vanity and ſeeke after leaſing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe I was the more Inquiſitive to learne out the truth of this particular, and had it thus related to mee by a worthy divine Doctor <hi>Wimberly,</hi> who dyning with my Lord of Canterbury the day after the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> Execution, had it from his own mouth. And my Lords grace it ſeems having heard of the miſtake, did at every period take the Lievetenant of the Tower, then preſent, his Atteſtation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>
            <p>That the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> the night before the Execution had ſent for the Lievetenant of the Tower and asked him whether it were poſſible hee might ſpeake with the Arch-Biſhop; the Lievetenant told him hee might not doe it without order from the Parliament. Maſter Lievetenant, ſaid hee, you ſhall heere what paſſeth betwixt us; it is not a time now either for him to plot Haeriſy, or me to plot Treaſon, The Lievetenant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that hee was limited, and therefore deſired his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would Petition the Parliament for that favour, no (ſaid hee) I have gotten my diſpatch from them, and will trouble them no more; I am now petitioning an higher Court, where neither partiality can bee expected, nor error feared, But my Lord (ſaid hee) turning to the Primate of Ireland, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, what I ſhould have ſpoken to my Lords grace of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, you ſhall deſire the Arch-Biſhop to lend me his prayers this night, and to give me his bleſſing when I doe go abroad to morrow, and to bee in his window that by my laſt farewell I may give him thanks for this, and all other his former favours.</p>
            <p>The Primate having delivered the meſſage without delay, the Arch-Biſhop replyed that in conſcience hee was bound to the firſt, and in duty and obligation to the ſecond, but he feared his weakneſſe and paſſion would not lend him eyes to behold his laſt departure.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:115498:52"/>
            <p> The next morning at his coming forth hee drew neere to the Arch-Biſhops lodgings? and ſayd to the Lievetenant, though I doe not ſee the Arch-Biſhop, yet give me leave I pray you to do my laſt obſervance toward his roomes; in the meane time the Arch-Biſhop, advertized of his approach, came out to the window; then the Earle bowing himſelfe to the ground, my Lord ſaid hee, your prayers and your bleſſing, the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop lift up his hand and beſtowed both, but overcome with griefe fell to the ground <hi>in Animi Diliquio.</hi> The Earle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a little farther, bowed the ſecond time ſaying, Farewell my Lord; God protect your Innocency.</p>
            <p>To this relation the Lord of Canterbury added, that it might perhaps ſeeme an effeminacy and ſoftneſſe unbecoming him, to bee ſo caſt down, but hee hoped by Gods Aſſiſtance and his own Innocency, that when hee came to his own Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution (which hee daily longed for) that the world ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hee had beene more ſencible of the Lord <hi>Straffords</hi> loſſe, then of his own; and good reaſon it ſhould bee ſo (ſaid hee) for the Gentleman was more ſerviceable to the Church (Hee would not mention the State) then either himſelfe or any of all the Church-men had ever beene.</p>
            <p>And that there may bee a ſlaughter-Goat for the ſinnes of the people in Scotland, to wait upon this report, they have fained another of the ſame meale, that the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury caſts back all his miſdemeanors upon the Biſhop of Roſs, as if either the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> had beene tutored by the Ach-Biſhop, or hee by the Biſhop of Roſs, in the King and Countryes ſervice; I did think that both of them had paſt their pupilage and could not have beene bended to execute the directions of any man living, but only their own Maſters, but this is a faire advertiſement to the Biſhop of Roſs, to make himſelfe the ſcape-Goat. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Give me leave to adjoyne one thing more, when hee was marching to the Scaffold more like the Generall in the head of an Army, to breath victory, then like a condemned man to undergoe the Sentence of Death, the Lievetenant of the Tower deſired him to take Coach, for feare the people ſhould ruſh in upon him and teare him in pieces, No (ſaid hee) Maſter Lievetenant I dare looke death in the face, and I hope the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115498:53"/> People too, have you a care that I doe not eſcape, and I care not how I die, whether by the hand of the Executioner, or the madneſſe and fury of the People. If that may give them better content, it is all one to me.</p>
            <p>It is but diminutive to call it a wonder, it is ſomething above, that his thoughts and expreſſions ſhould be ſo preſent with him, no more putrifaction in them, then if he had beene about ſome ordinary buſineſſe: His Alacrity, his Devotion did amaze; yea, teare in peeces the hearts of all thoſe about him, who had the leaſt Grace or Humanity in them.</p>
            <p>Too much Perfection indeed to be loſt at one blow, but this Age was not worthy of it, nor ſhall any after Age, I thinke, ever enjoy the like, that only which is poſſible is the object of the will, and therefore I will not endeavor to find out words for expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this wonder of the times; only I leave his virtues to ſpeake the reſt, to the <hi>Admiration of Ours, and Compaſſion of ſucceeding Ages.</hi>

                  <p>Moſt true it is, that ſuch an attempt (my private condition conſidered) had beene a great madneſſe, ſeeing through your gracious favour, I was ſo provided as I could not expect in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinde to mend my Fortune, or to pleaſe my minde more then by reſting where your bounteous hand had placed me: nay, the buſineſſe is moſt mightily miſtaken, for unto your
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115498:54"/> Majeſty it is well knowne, that my poore and humble advices concluded ſtill in this, That your Majeſty ſhould never be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py till there were a right-underſtanding procured betwixt you and them: no other meanes to effect and ſettle this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but by the Councell and Aſſent of the Parliament: and no way to prevent the growing evills of this State, but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelfe entirely upon the Loyalty and good-Affection of your Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Yet (ſuch is my misfortune) the Truth finds little credit, the Contrary (it ſeemes) generally beleeved, and my ſelfe reputed the Cauſe of this great ſeparation betwixt you and your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Under a heavier Cenſure then this, I am perſwaded no Gentleman can ſuffer, and now I underſtand that the mindes of men are the more incenſed againſt me, notwithſtanding your Majeſty hath declared, That in your Princely opinion, I am not guilty of Treaſon, nor are you ſatisfied in Conſcience to paſſe the Bill: This brings me into a great Streight. Here is before me the ruine of my Children and Family, hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touc't in all the branches of it with any foule Crime. Here are before me the many evills which may befall your ſacred Perſon and the whole Kingdome, ſhould your ſelfe and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be leſſe ſatisfied the one with the other than is neceſſary for the King and People. Here are before me the things moſt valued, moſt feared, by mortall men [Life and Death:] To ſay Sir, there hath not beene a conflict within me, about theſe things, were to make my ſelfe leſſe man then (God knowes) my infirmities will give me leave, and to call a deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelfe and my yong children, where the intentions (at leaſt) of my heart, have beene innocent of this great Offence (may be beleeved) would finde no eaſie conſent from fleſh and blood,</p>
                  <p>But, out of much ſadneſſe, I am come to a Reſolution of that which I take to be beſt becomming me, that is, To looke upon that which is principally to be conſidered in it ſelfe, and that is doubtleſſe the proſperity of your ſacred Perſon and the Common-wealth, infinitely to be preferred before any mans private intereſt: And therefore, in few words, as I have put my ſelfe wholly upon the Honour and Juſtice of my Peers, ſo cleerely as I wiſh your Majeſty had beene pleaſed to have ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                     <salute>My L. Primate of Ireland.</salute>

                  <p>IT is my very great comfort that I have your Lordſhip by me this day, in regard I have beene known to you theſe many yeares, and I doe thank God and your Lordſhip for it that you are heere, I ſhould bee very glad to obteine ſo
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115498:57"/> much ſilence as to bee heard a few words, but I doubt I ſhall not, the noiſe is ſo great. My Lords, I am come hither by the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God, to pay that laſt debt I owe to ſinne; which is death, and by the bleſſing of that God, to riſe again through the mirrits of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> to righteouſneſſe and life aeternall. [Heere hee was a little interrupted.]</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I am come hither to ſubmit to that Judgement which hath paſſed againſt me, I do it with a very quiet and contented minde, I thank God, I doe freely forgive all the world, a forgiveneſſe, that is not ſpoken from the teeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (as they ſay) but from the very heart; I ſpeake it in the preſence of Almighty God, before whome I ſtand, that there is not a diſpleaſing thought ariſing in me towards any man living. I thank God I can ſay it, and truly too, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bearing me witneſſe, that in all my imployment ſince I had the Honour to ſerve his Majeſtie, I never had any thing in the purpoſe of my heart but what tended to the Joynt and Individuall proſperity of King, and people; although it hath beene my ill fortune to bee miſconſtrued.</p>
                  <p>I am not the firſt that hath ſuffered in this kinde, it is the common portion of us all, while wee are in this life to err, Righteous Judgment wee muſt wait for in another place, for heere we are very ſubject to bee miſ-judged one of another; there is one thing that I deſire to free my ſelfe of, and I am very confident (ſpeaking it now with ſo much cheerfullneſſe) that I ſhall obteine your Chriſtian charity in the beliefe of it. I was ſo farre from being againſt Parliaments, That I did all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes think the Parliaments of England, were the moſt happy conſtitutions that any Kingdome or Nation lived under, and the beſt means under God to make the King &amp; people happy.</p>
                  <p>For my Death I heere acquit all the world, and beſeech the God of Heaven heartily to forgive them that contrived it, though in the Intentions and purpoſes of my heart I am not guilty of what I dy for; And my Lord Primate it is a great comfort for me, that his Majeſty conceives me not merriting ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſhment as is the utmoſt execution of this Sentence. I do infinitly rejoyce in this mercy of his, and I beſeech God returne it into his own boſome, that hee may find mercy when hee ſtands moſt in neede of it.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115498:58"/> I wiſh this Kingdome all the Proſperity and happineſſe in the world, I did it living, and now dying it is my wiſh, I doe moſt humbly recommend this to every one who heares mee, and deſire they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and conſider ſeriouſly whether the beginning of the happineſſe and reformation of a Kingdome ſhould bee written in Letters of blood; conſider this when you are at your homes, and let me be never ſo unhappy, as that the laſt drop of my blood ſhould riſe up in Judgement againſt any one of you, But I feare you are in a wrong way.</p>
                  <p>My Lords I have but one word more, and with that I ſhall end. I profeſſe that I dy a true and obedient Sonne to the Church of England, wherein I was borne and in which I was bred. Peace and proſperity bee ever to it.</p>
                  <p>It hath beene objected (if it were an objection worth the anſwering) that I have beene inclined to Popery, but I ſay truly from my heart, that from the time that I was one and twenty yeares of age to this preſent, going now upon fourty nine, I never had in my heart to doubt of this Religion of the Church of England; Nor ever had any man the boldneſſe to ſuggeſt any ſuch thing to mee, to the beſt of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſo being reconciled, by the merrits of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> my <hi>Saviour,</hi> into whoſe boſome I hope I ſhall ſhortly bee gathered, to thoſe eternall happineſſes which ſhall never have end; I deſire heartily the forgiveneſſe, of every man, for any raſh or unadviſed words, or any thing done amiſſe, and ſo my Lords and Gentlemen Farewell; Farewell all the things of this world.</p>
                  <p>I deſire that you would bee ſilent and joyne with me in prayer, and I truſt in God wee ſhall all meet and live eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heaven, there to receive the Accompliſhment of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, where every teare ſhall bee wiped away from our eyes, and every ſad thought from our hearts; and ſo God bleſſe this Kingdome, and Jeſus have mercy on my Soule.</p>

            <p>Then turning himſelfe about hee Saluted all the noble men; and tooke a ſolemne leave of all conſiderable perſons upon the Scaffold, giving them his hand.</p>
            <p>After that hee ſaid, Gentlemen, I would ſay my prayers, and entreate you all to pray with me, and for me; then his Chaplaine layd the booke of Common-prayer upon the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115498:58"/> Chayre before him, as hee kneeled downe, on which hee prayed almoſt a quarter of an houre, and then as long or longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Booke, and concluded with the Lords prayer.</p>
            <p>Standing up hee eſpies his Brother, Sir <hi>George Wentworth,</hi> and calls him to him ſaying, Brother we muſt part, remember me to my ſiſter, and to my wife, and carry my bleſſing to my Sonne, and charge him that hee feare God, and continue an obedient Sonne to the Church of England, and warne him that hee beares no private grudge or revenge toward any man concerning me; And bid him beware that hee meddle not with Church-livings, for that will prove a moth and canker to him in his eſtate, and wiſh him to content himſelfe to bee a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his Country, not ayming at higher Preferments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aliter]</hi> To his Sonne Maſter <hi>Wentworth</hi> hee commends himſelfe, and gives him charge to ſerve his God, to ſubmit to his King with all faith and Allegiance in things temporall, to the Church in things Spirituall, chargeth him againe and againe, as hee will anſwer it to him in heaven, never to meddle with the Patrimony of the Church, for if he did, it would be a Canker to eate up the reſt of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Carry my bleſſing alſo to my daughter <hi>Anne,</hi> and <hi>Arabella,</hi> charge them to ſerve and feare God, and hee will bleſſe them; not forgetting my little Infant, who yet knowes neither good nor evill and cannot ſpeake for it ſelfe, God ſpeake for it, and bleſſe it; now ſaid hee I have nigh done, one Stroke will make my wife husbandleſſe, my deare children fatherleſſe, and my poore Servants Maſterleſſe, and will ſeperate me from my deare brother, and all my friends. But let God bee to you and them all in all.</p>
            <p>After this going to take off his doublet and to make himſelf unready, hee ſaid, I thank God I am not affraid of Death, nor daunted with any diſcouragement riſing from any feares, but doe as chearfully put off my doublet at this time, as ever I did when I went to bed; then hee put off his Doublet, wound up his haire with his hands, and put on a white Cap.</p>
            <p>Then hee called, where is the man that is to doe this laſt office? (meaning the executioner) call him to me; when hee came and asked him forgiveneſſe, hee told him he forgave him and all the world: then kneeling down by the block; hee went to prayer againe himſelfe, The Primate of Ireland kneeling
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115498:59"/> on the one ſide, and the Miniſter on the other: To the which Miniſter, after prayer, hee turned himſelfe, having done pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſpake ſome few words ſoftly, having his hands lifted up, and cloſed with the Miniſters hands.</p>
            <p>Then bowing himſelfe to lay his head upon the block, he told the Executioner that hee would firſt lay down his head to try the fitneſſe of the block, and take it up againe before he would lay it down for good and all: And ſo he did; and before he layed it down again, he told the Executioner that he would give him warning when to ſtrike by ſtretching forth his hands; And preſently laying down his neck upon the block, and ſtretching forth his hands, the Executioner ſtrooke off his head at one blow, and taking it up in his hand ſhewed it to all the people: And ſayd. <hi>God ſave the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His body was afterwards embalmed, and appointed to be carried into York-ſhire, there to be buried amongſt his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He left theſe three Inſtructions for his Sonne in Writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That hee ſhould continue ſtill to be brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Governors to whom hee had committed him; As being the beſt he could pick out of all thoſe within his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that he ſhould not change them, unleſſe they were weary of him; that he ſhould rather want himſelfe, then they ſhould want any thing they could deſire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He charged him as he would anſwer it at the laſt day, not to put himſelfe upon any publique employments till he was thirty yeares of age at leaſt: And then if his Prince ſhould call him to Publique Service, he ſhould carefully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, to teſtify his obedience, and withall to be faithfull and ſincere to his Maſter, though he ſhould come to the ſame end that himſelfe did.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That he ſhould never lay any hand upon any thing that belonged to the Church; He foreſaw that ruine was like to come upon the Revennues of the Church, and that parhaps they might be ſhared amongſt the Nobility, and Gentry: But if his Sonne medled with any of it, he wiſhed the curſe of God might follow him, and all them, to the Deſtruction <hi>of the moſt Apostolicall Church upon Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
